# `claim` and `claimByMerkleProof` can be called by anyone, burning voting power for any users and manipulating voting results

## Summary

All functions which can claim amounts owed to users also burn the corresponding amount of voting power for the user (decreasing `totalSupply` for the internal voting token). Since claim functions for any user can be called by anyone (not by just the user who's claiming), this makes it possible for malicious user to claim for all the other users, burning their voting power (which might be against the users expectations if they wanted to vote and didn't want to claim). Moreover, this action will also decrease the `totalSupply` of the voting token, making the share of vote of the malicious user much higher than it should be and potentially manipulating the voting results.

## Vulnerability Detail

`BasicDistributor`'s `claim` function can be called by anyone:

`CrosschainMerkleDistributor`'s `claimByMerkleProof` function cal also be called by anyone:

The same is also true for `ContinuousVestingMerkle`, `PriceTierVestingMerkle` and `PriceTierVestingSale_2_0`

https://github.com/sherlock-audit/2023-06-tokensoft/blob/main/contracts/contracts/claim/PriceTierVestingSale_2_0.sol#L97

All claim functions call `_executeClaim`, which burns the internal voting token for the user:

https://github.com/sherlock-audit/2023-06-tokensoft/blob/main/contracts/contracts/claim/abstract/AdvancedDistributor.sol#L87-L95

This makes it possible for any user to burn voting tokens for the other users by calling claim on their behalf.

## Impact

Users unexpectedly can lose their voting tokens. Malicious user can significantly increase its share of voting tokens by burning them for the other users, calling claim on their behalf, which can lead to voting results manipulations.

## Recommendation

Restrict all claim functions to be only initiated by the claiming user, not by anyone.
