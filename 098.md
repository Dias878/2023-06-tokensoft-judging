# _setTotal will revert

## Summary
_setTotal will always revert  when updating  the total again because of safeApprove 
## Vulnerability Detail
the function CrosschainDistribution._setTotal is  to set  the total amount and  calls **_allowConnect**  and this function   uses ERC20 safeApprove() from OpenZeppelin's SafeERC20  to approve 
and  the safeApprove function prevents changing an allowance between non-zero values to mitigate a possible front-running attack. It reverts if that is the case. Instead, the **safeIncreaseAllowance** and **safeDecreaseAllowance** functions should be used. Comment from the OZ library for this function:  **safeApprove** should only be called when setting an initial allowance, or when resetting it to zero. To increase and decrease it, use **safeIncreaseAllowance** and **safeDecreaseAllowance**
## Impact
when trying to update the total amount it will revert since it has been approved before and when  approving again it might be between non-zero values
