# Changes to `voteFactor` can lead to unclaimable tokens

## Summary
Upon initialization of a user's DistributionRecord, they are minted voting power based on the current `voteFactor` value. Upon claiming tokens, their voting power is burned based on the current `votefactor`. Therefore, if the `voteFactor` were to increase between these actions by calling `setVoteFactor()`, users would not be able to claim their full amount of tokens.

## Vulnerability Detail
Users receive voting power when their DistributionRecord is initialized:

```solidity
  function _initializeDistributionRecord(
    address beneficiary,
    uint256 totalAmount
  ) internal virtual override {
    super._initializeDistributionRecord(beneficiary, totalAmount);


    // add voting power through ERC20Votes extension
    _mint(beneficiary, tokensToVotes(totalAmount));
  }
```

This mints voting power as a function of the current `voteFactor` value:

```solidity
  function tokensToVotes(uint256 tokenAmount) private view returns (uint256) {
    return (tokenAmount * voteFactor) / fractionDenominator;
  }
```

When the user claims their tokens, their voting power is burned based on the same `tokensToVotes` calculation. Therefore, any increase in vote factor will lead to unclaimable funds.

```solidity
  function _executeClaim(
    address beneficiary,
    uint256 totalAmount
  ) internal virtual override returns (uint256 _claimed) {
    _claimed = super._executeClaim(beneficiary, totalAmount);


    // reduce voting power through ERC20Votes extension
    _burn(beneficiary, tokensToVotes(_claimed));
  }
```

## Tool used
Manual Review

## Recommendation
The lengthy and expensive mitigation would involve keeping a record of holders and mint/burn them a proportional amount of voting power in case the `voteFactor` changes.

## Final note
Oppositely, if the `voteFactor` were to decrease, the token claim would succeed but user's would retain voting power after claiming their entire distribution. All this to say, **any change** to the `voteFactor` leads to undesirable circumstances without accounting for the change in the existing voting power balances.
