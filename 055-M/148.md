# Setting a new Vote Factor through a `setVoteFactor()` call could cause a Denial of Service in the airdrops

## Summary
Setting a new Vote Factor through a `setVoteFactor()` call could cause a Denial of Service in the airdrops as during the claim "voting power" is burnt. If the voting factor is increased contracts would try to burn more tokens than what they were minted in the first place, reverting and blocking the airdrops.

## Vulnerability Detail
Setting a new Vote Factor through a `setVoteFactor()` call could cause a Denial of Service in the airdrops as during the claim "voting power" is burnt:
`AdvanceDistributor` contract:
```solidity
  function _executeClaim(
    address beneficiary,
    uint256 totalAmount
  ) internal virtual override returns (uint256 _claimed) {
    _claimed = super._executeClaim(beneficiary, totalAmount);

    // reduce voting power through ERC20Votes extension
    _burn(beneficiary, tokensToVotes(_claimed));
  }
```

```solidity
  function tokensToVotes(uint256 tokenAmount) private view returns (uint256) {
    return (tokenAmount * voteFactor) / fractionDenominator;
  }
```

If the voting factor is increased contracts would try to burn more tokens than what they were minted in the first place, reverting and blocking the airdrops.

For example, based in the following tranches:
```solidity
Tranche[] memory _tranches = new Tranche[](3);
_tranches[0].time = uint128(block.timestamp + 2 weeks);
_tranches[0].vestedFraction = 2000;
_tranches[1].time = uint128(block.timestamp + 4 weeks);
_tranches[1].vestedFraction = 5000;
_tranches[2].time = uint128(block.timestamp + 8 weeks);
_tranches[2].vestedFraction = 10000;
```

After the week 4, user has claimed 50% of the tokens. Owner calls `contract_CrosschainTrancheVestingMerkle.setVoteFactor(30000);`. (Previous vote factor was 20000).

Then after week 8, user tries to claim his remaining vested tokens but it reverts:
```solidity
User1 calls -> contract_CrosschainTrancheVestingMerkle(user1_merkle, user1_amount, user1_proof)) [staticcall]
    │   └─ ← ()
    ├─ [6449] CrosschainTrancheVestingMerkle::claimByMerkleProof(0x3C44CdDdB6a900fa2b585dd299e03d12FA4293BC, 1000000000000000000000, [0xf5b0a8ab36ea660fc49be7b652379674f63c6f27ff3ff540ef241d665d5f4c43])       
    │   └─ ← "ERC20: burn amount exceeds balance"
    └─ ← "ERC20: burn amount exceeds balance"
```

## Impact
Airdrops would be blocked. Users would not be able to claim.

## Tool used
Manual Review

## Recommendation
Disallow setting a new voting factor after contract initialization.
