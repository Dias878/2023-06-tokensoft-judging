# Should burn existing minted token for all beneficiaries before changing voteFactor

## Summary
Should burn existing minted token for all beneficiaries before changing voteFactor

## Vulnerability Detail
ERC20Votes token is minted based on beneficiary's total amount

```solidity
struct DistributionRecord {
  uint120 total; // total token quantity claimable
}
```

It is calculated using the following formula

```solidity
TokenToVotes = (tokenAmount * voteFactor) / fractionDenominator
```

where the minting procedure can be accessible by owner or anyone. [Note: if only owner can mint the token, then this issue is invalid].

The voteFactor can be changed by owner. 

```solidity
  function setVoteFactor(uint256 _voteFactor) external onlyOwner {
    voteFactor = _voteFactor;
    emit SetVoteFactor(voteFactor);
  }
```  

Before changing voteFactor, system should ensure all tokens minted using old voteFactor to be burned using old voteFactor.

## Impact
If not,  either 1 or 2 would happen

1. Beneficiary's distributionRecord.total may have record even when all his tokens are burned
2. Beneficiary's distributionRecord.total may have zero record, yet his tokens are not yet finish burned
