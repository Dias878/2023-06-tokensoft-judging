# Changing the `voteFactor` messes up the voting powers of recipients with already initiated `distributionRecords`

## Summary

When the owner changes the `voteFactor`, the change does not apply to already minted voting tokens. This leads to skewed voting powers for recipients whose `distributionRecord` is already initiated and can even lead to people having voting rights even if they have claimed all their tokens


## Vulnerability Detail

When initiating a `distributionRecord`, voting tokens are minted to the recipient based on the current `voteFactor` . If a recipient claims some of his tokens, voting tokens are burned based on the current `voteFactor`. 

If the owner changes the `voteFactor` after any `distributionRecord` has been initiated, this change does not influence the voting tokens a recipient already ownes. This means, that if the `voteFactor` is increased, the recipients that already have voting tokens have to little voting power, if the factor is decreased, they have to much. This can even lead to recipients still having voting power even though they have claimed all their tokens.

Example:

The total calaimable supply is 100 tokens, the `voteFactor` = 2.
Alice and Bob can both claim 50% of the tokens meaning they should have 50% of the voting power. 
Bob initates his `distributionRecord` and gets 100 * 50% * 2 = 100 voting tokens.

The owner changes the `voteFactor` to 1.
Alice initiates her `distributionRecord` and gets 100*50% *1 = 50 voting tokens.
Bob claims his 50 tokens and thereby burns 50*1 = 50 voting tokens.
Even though Bob claimed all his tokens he still has the same voting powe as Alice 

## Impact

The voting power of the recipients are falsely represented rendering the voting mechanism useless

## Tool used

Manual Review

## Recommendation

Changing the `voteFactor` should not be possible if there is any supply of the voting token
