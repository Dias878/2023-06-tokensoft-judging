# Increasing vote factor can have unintended consequences

## Summary

The owner has the ability to increase vote factor (by calling `setVoteFactor()`) however this has the unintended side effect of:

1. Users whose distribution records were initialized previously are not able to claim
2. Users whose distribution records were initialized previously are minted less vote tokens

As this is a bug with the current design, I’ve categorized the severity as medium.

## Vulnerability Detail

The core of this vulnerability lies with how votes are calculated i.e. `tokensToVotes()`. Assuming an initially configured vote factor of 10%, if a user has a `totalAmount` of 100, it means that 10 vote tokens will be minted to the user.

Assuming some time has passed, and the owner decides to increase the vote factor to 15%. When the user tries to claim the tokens, the code will attempt to burn 15 vote tokens however the user was only minted 10 vote tokens so the user’s claim function will fail.

## Impact

If the vote factor is increased, users who had their vote tokens minted previously will not be able to claim as they have insufficient vote tokens to burn.

Moreover, if the vote factor were to be increased, the users who had their vote tokens minted previously have less vote tokens than intended.

## Tool used

Manual Review

## Recommendation

- Let users mint more vote tokens manually if the vote factor increases
- Setting vote factor will retroactively mint more tokens to all users (more complex but ideal)
- burning tokens will just burn the vote token balance of the user instead of calculating the number of vote tokens to burn.
