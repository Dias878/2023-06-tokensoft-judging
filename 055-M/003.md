# `AdvancedDistributer` - Wrong mechanism around `voteFactor` and voting power

## Summary
Voting power management using `voteFactor` is wrong because the `voteFactor` can change.

## Vulnerability Detail
In `AdvancedDistributor`, `voteFactor` can be set by the owner and it can be updated multiple times.
This exposes a vulnerability in claiming rewards and calculating voting power.

When `voteFactor` is updated to a bigger one, users will not be able to claim their rewards because burning vote tokens will revert.
When `voteFactor` is updated to a smaller one, users will still have their remaining voting power even after claiming all rewards.

## Impact
Based on how `voteFactor` is changed, claiming / adjustments will not be working or users will have their voting power even though they don't have rewards to claim.

Manual Review

## Recommendation
Either implement user-specific voting power or overwrite `balanceOf` function to reflect `voteFactor` in it.
