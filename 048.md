## Summary
The [PriceTierVesting._getOraclePrice()](https://github.com/sherlock-audit/2023-06-tokensoft/blob/main/contracts/contracts/claim/abstract/PriceTierVesting.sol#L30) function is used to get the price of tokens, the problem is that [the function](https://github.com/sherlock-audit/2023-06-tokensoft/blob/main/contracts/contracts/claim/abstract/PriceTierVesting.sol#L31-L37) does not check for stale results.

## Vulnerability Detail
The [PriceTierVesting._getOraclePrice()](https://github.com/sherlock-audit/2023-06-tokensoft/blob/main/contracts/contracts/claim/abstract/PriceTierVesting.sol#L30) function is used in [getVestedFraction](https://github.com/sherlock-audit/2023-06-tokensoft/blob/main/contracts/contracts/claim/abstract/PriceTierVesting.sol#L67). The PriceTierVesting._getOraclePrice() helps to determine the tokens prices managed in the contracts (according to prize Tier).

The problem is that there is not check for stale data. There are some [reasons](https://ethereum.stackexchange.com/questions/133242/how-future-resilient-is-a-chainlink-price-feed/133843#133843) that the price feed can become stale.

## Impact
Since these Oracle prices are used for calculation [vestedFraction](https://github.com/sherlock-audit/2023-06-tokensoft/blob/main/contracts/contracts/claim/abstract/PriceTierVesting.sol#L84-L92) , stale data could be catastrophic for the project.

## Tool used

Manual Review

## Recommendation
Read the [updatedAt](https://docs.chain.link/data-feeds/api-reference#latestrounddata) return value from the Chainlink.latestRoundData() function and verify that is not older than than specific time tolerance.

require(block.timestamp - timeStamp < toleranceTime, "stale price");
So using this method we have assurance that price is fresh upto a given Tolerancetime.
