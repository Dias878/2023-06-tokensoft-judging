# Missing Of Sanity Check For `_start`, `_cliff` & `_end` In `setVestingConfig()`

## Summary
See Detail
## Vulnerability Detail
There is a `Adjustable admin functions` `setVestingConfig()` for re-setting `_start`, `_cliff` & `_end` In `ContinuousVesting.sol` contract.

As These variable are initialized in Contract `constructor` There are some pre-define condition checks which should these state variable statisfy.
```solidity
	{
		require(_start <= _cliff, "vesting cliff before start");
		require(_cliff <= _end, "vesting end before cliff");
		require(_end <= 4102444800, "vesting ends after 4102444800 (Jan 1 2100)");

		start = _start;
		cliff = _cliff;
		end = _end;

		emit SetContinuousVesting(start, cliff, end);
	}
```
But These checks are absence in case of `re-initialization` i.e in function `setVestingConfig()`
```solidity
	function setVestingConfig( // @audit-issue no checks as in constructor 
		uint256 _start,
		uint256 _cliff,
		uint256 _end
	) external onlyOwner {
		start = _start;
		cliff = _cliff;
		end = _end;
		emit SetContinuousVesting(start, cliff, end);
	}
```
## Impact
Owner could set Wrong value as Sanity checks are not present.

## Recommendation
Should implement those sanity check as in `constructor` in `setVestingConfig()`
