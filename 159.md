# `DistributionRecord` does not support multiple same beneficiary address in MerkleRoot

## Summary

If offchain MerkleTree builder does not deduplicate same `address`.
It will cause issue where one address can receive multiple airdrops, the address can only receive the airdrop once.

## Vulnerability Detail

- MerkleProof verification using `keccak(index,address,amount)` as [hash for leaf](https://github.com/sherlock-audit/2023-06-tokensoft/blob/main/contracts/contracts/claim/ContinuousVestingMerkle.sol#L50).
- So if offchain merkle tree fail to **dedup** same address, the address can claim using multiple leaf hash that share same address.
- [The amount of token airdrop](https://github.com/sherlock-audit/2023-06-tokensoft/blob/main/contracts/contracts/claim/abstract/Distributor.sol#L121) is depend on `Distributor.getClaimableAmount()`. Based on total amount in `Record` mapping.
- The total amount is overrided each time user [claim](https://github.com/sherlock-audit/2023-06-tokensoft/blob/main/contracts/contracts/claim/abstract/AdvancedDistributor.sol#L87-L95) or [mint](https://github.com/sherlock-audit/2023-06-tokensoft/blob/main/contracts/contracts/claim/abstract/AdvancedDistributor.sol#L77-L85) voteToken. [Here](https://github.com/sherlock-audit/2023-06-tokensoft/blob/main/contracts/contracts/claim/abstract/Distributor.sol#L57).
- Each time user [claiming using one of merkle leafs](https://github.com/sherlock-audit/2023-06-tokensoft/blob/main/contracts/contracts/claim/ContinuousVestingMerkle.sol#L55-L69). The maximum amount of token that can be claimed is [overrided again](https://github.com/sherlock-audit/2023-06-tokensoft/blob/main/contracts/contracts/claim/abstract/Distributor.sol#L73-L76).
- Hence, user cannot claim tokens from multiple airdrop using same address. As the total amount keep being overwritten on each `claim()` call

## Impact

Onchain Airdrop distribution contract does not support multiple same beneficiary address in MerkleRoot.
Whether the issue become complicated or not depends on how the offchain MerkleTree builder deduplicate same address.

When it fail, it require admin intervention to manually `adjust()` token for user.

## Tool used

Manual Review

## Recommendation

Consider replace `_initializeDistributionRecord()` with `increasingDistributionRecord()`.
Only increase token `totalAmount` for each `validMerkleProof` once. Then burn that hash away.
