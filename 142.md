# Missing check in `PriceTierVesting` if the oracle has hit the max price of the circuit breaker can prevent users to claim tokens that should be claimable

## Summary

Chainlink Oracles have a build in circuit breaker that is triggered if the price of an asset increases or decreases to fast. The result is that if the price increases to fast the `maxPrice` of the oracle is returned and not the real price. This can prevent users to claim tokens that should be claimable.

## Vulnerability Detail

If the price of the token increases fast and the circuit breaker is hit, the `maxPrice` is returned instead of the real price. If the real price would have unlocked tokens to be claimed, a claim would still not be possible since the `maxPrice` is used for calculating the `VestedFraction`. Since tokens can only be claimed while the oracle price is above the `tierPrice`, if the price falls below the tier price again, recipients will not be able to claim the tokens at a later point of time.   

## Impact
Recipients can not claim tokens that should be claimable and potentially miss out on financial gains they could have had when claiming the tokens and selling them.

## Tool used

Manual Review

## Recommendation

Integrate a check if the circuit breaker of an oracle has been triggered and if so use a backup oracle like a Uniswap pool to determine the real price
