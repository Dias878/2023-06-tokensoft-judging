# User can claim tokens without ERC20Votes being burned

## Summary
A malicious user can claim tokens in all contracts without having his ERC20Votes burned
## Vulnerability Detail
The amount of tokens to be burned is calculated as follows: return (tokenAmount * voteFactor) / fractionDenominator;
In the case where we have a low tokenAmount or a low voteFactor compared to fractionDenominator, this calculation will result in a 0, which will lead to 0 tokens being burned, even if tokenAmount was claimed. 

Example: when using the continous vesting, the tokens become claimable with time. Imagine we have a voteFactor=10 ** 17 and a fractionDenominator=10 ** 18. In case we call the claim() function each time 9 tokens are claimable, the calculation would be: (9 * 10 ** 17) / 10 ** 18, which will round to 0 in Solidity. This means that if a malicious user calls the claim() function each time that 9 tokens are claimable, we would get 0 ERC20Votes tokens burned each time, resulting in him claiming all the tokens but keeping his ERC20Votes over time.
## Impact
Medium: the user can conserve all his ERC20Votes while also claiming all his tokens.

## Tool used

Manual Review

## Recommendation
Round up this calculation. This will result in the end in more ERC20Votes tokens being burned from the user than possible, so you have to take into account this.
