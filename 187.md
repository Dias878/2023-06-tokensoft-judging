# `adjust()` In `AdvancedDistributor.sol` Contract Expose To Front-Running By Users

## Summary
`adjust()` called by Owner can be front-run by User and make manipulation in favour of him before adjustment of his 'total' ocure by Owner Tx. 
## Vulnerability Detail
Here `adjust()` used by `Owner` to reset `benificiary's` token `amount`
Depending Upon input parameter `int256 amount` amount get deducted from benificiary's total i.e `records[beneficiary].total` or added to it.

So a User can track mempool, and front-run Owner transaction on his suitable senario like Claiming before Owner adjust his `total` amount.

```solidity
 function adjust(address beneficiary, int256 amount) external onlyOwner {
    DistributionRecord memory distributionRecord = records[beneficiary];
    require(distributionRecord.initialized, 'must initialize before adjusting');

    uint256 diff = uint256(amount > 0 ? amount : -amount);
    require(diff < type(uint120).max, 'adjustment > max uint120');

    if (amount < 0) {
      // decreasing claimable tokens
      require(total >= diff, 'decrease greater than distributor total');
      require(distributionRecord.total >= diff, 'decrease greater than distributionRecord total');
      total -= diff;
      records[beneficiary].total -= uint120(diff);
      token.safeTransfer(owner(), diff);
      // reduce voting power
      _burn(beneficiary, tokensToVotes(diff));
    } else {
      // increasing claimable tokens
      total += diff;
      records[beneficiary].total += uint120(diff);
      // increase voting pwoer
      _mint(beneficiary, tokensToVotes(diff));
    }

    emit Adjust(beneficiary,
