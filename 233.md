# Anyone can mint tokens by re-using their proof

## Summary
Anyone can mint tokens by re-using their proof.

## Vulnerability Detail
The function `initializeDistributionRecord` https://github.com/sherlock-audit/2023-06-tokensoft/blob/1f58ddb066ab383c416cfcbf95c9902683506e96/contracts/contracts/claim/PriceTierVestingMerkle.sol#L49-L60

does not check that the user has already minted/used that proof to mint tokens.

An attacker should only introduce the same proof again and mint more tokens.

## Impact
Inflate the supply of tokens by artificially minting

## Tool used

Manual Review

## Recommendation
When calling `initializeDistributionRecord` do check that the proof has not been used before.
