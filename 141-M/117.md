# The `_setTotal` function will consistently revert in `CrosschainDistributor`

## Summary

When using OpenZeppelin's safeApprove() function, if it is already approved, and a new safeApprove() is attempted with a non-zero value, it will result in a revert.

This occurs in the `_setTotal` function, which prevents updating setTotal always.

safeApprove should only be called when setting an initial allowance, or when resetting it to zero. To increase and decrease it, use 'safeIncreaseAllowance' and 'safeDecreaseAllowance'

    function _setTotal(uint256 _total) internal virtual override onlyOwner {
        // effects
        super._setTotal(_total);
        // interactions
        _allowConnext(total - claimed); // @audit re-approve?
    }

## Tool used

Manual Review

## Recommendation

Whenever possible, use {safeIncreaseAllowance} and {safeDecreaseAllowance} instead.
Alternatively, use `safeApprove()` with an amount of 0 first, and then use `safeApprove()` again to set the new amount in `_setTotal` function.
