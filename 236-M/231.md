# same address from two differant chains cannot be beneficed for airdrop

## Summary
In airdrops distrubitor can give tokens to a benficary with seperating two differant chain. If this situation happen beneficar cannot claim all his tokens because total and claimed values calculated in single address. 
## Vulnerability Detail
For example Bob can claim from 2 chain.In X chain he can claim 10 token and in Y he can claim 20 token. With merkle proof he claim from x chain 10 token and when he try to claim from Y chain claimable amount will be 10 because claimed amount will be recorded as 10 token. So he cannot claim his 10 token.
