# Can't change the merkle root

## Summary
Can't change the Merkle root

## Vulnerability Detail
In the Satellite contract, the merkle root is declared as private and usually in most of the contracts, the internal function:

```solidity
  function _setMerkleRoot(bytes32 _merkleRoot) internal {
    merkleRoot = _merkleRoot;
    emit SetMerkleRoot(merkleRoot);
  }
```
is called from the main contract inheriting Merkle set.

In the case of the satellite contract, there is no function to update the Merkle root, which if it is upgraded, it will cause that Tokensoft will have to re-deploy 

## Impact
Tokensoft might have to re-deploy if the tokenRoot is new.

## Tool used

Manual Review

## Recommendation
Add:

```diff
 + function setMerkleRoot(bytes32 _merkleRoot) external onlyOwner {   
    _setMerkleRoot(_merkleRoot);
  }
```
