# The user has no control over the crosschain transaction because `delegate` is `address(0)`

## Summary

The user has no control over the crosschain transaction because `delegate` is `address(0)`

## Vulnerability Detail

In `Satellite.sol` we have `initiateClaim()` function. This fucntion initiates crosschain claim by msg.sender. `initiateClaim()` call `connext.xcall`:

```solidity
87:    // Send claim to distributor via crosschain call
88:    bytes32 transferId = connext.xcall{ value: msg.value }(  
89:      _distributorDomain, // destination domain              
90:      address(distributor), // to
91:      address(0), // asset    //@audit - missing delegate
92:      address(0), // delegate, only required for self-execution + slippage
93:      0, // total
94:      0, // slippage
95:      abi.encodePacked(msg.sender, _domain, total, proof) 
96:    );
```

On line 92 we notice that in place of `delegate` we have `address(0)` assuming you won't have to because there's no slippage. But `delegate` is important not only because of slippage.

According to connext docs `delegate`  is:

> An address on destination domain that has rights to update slippage tolerance, retry transactions, or revert back to origin in the event that a transaction fails at the destination.

[Reference](https://docs.connext.network/developers/reference/contracts/calls#functions)

Left at `address(0)`, absolutely no one has control of the transaction and according to the documentation it is entirely possible that the transaction remains stuck or some event happens and transaction fails at the destination. 

## Impact

When a transaction remains stuck or some event happens and the transaction fails at the destination we have no way to respond.

## Tool used

Manual Review

## Recommendation

Replace `address(0)` with `msg.sender` or `address(distributor)` to have some control over the transaction in case it gets stuck or you need to repeat it.
