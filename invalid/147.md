# Single-step Ownership Transfer Can be Dangerous

## Summary
Single-step Ownership Transfer Can be Dangerous
## Vulnerability Detail
Single-step ownership transfer means that if a wrong address was passed when transferring ownership or admin rights it can mean that role is lost forever. If the admin permissions are given to the wrong address within this function, it will cause irreparable damage to the contract.
`import "@openzeppelin/contracts/access/Ownable.sol";`
Below is the official documentation explanation from OpenZeppelinï¼š
https://docs.openzeppelin.com/contracts/4.x/api/access
`Ownable is a simpler mechanism with a single owner "role" that can be assigned to a single account. This simpler mechanism can be useful for quick tests but projects with production concerns are likely to outgrow it.`
## Impact
This will render the contract unusable, and the administrators have significant privileges on the contract.

## Tool used

Manual Review

## Recommendation
It is a best practice to use a two-step ownership transfer pattern, meaning ownership transfer gets to a "pending" state and the new owner should claim his new rights, otherwise the old owner still has control of the contract.
