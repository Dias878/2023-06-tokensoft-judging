# No check if L2 Sequencer is not down

## Summary
When making use of Chainlink Oracles in L2 chains, such as Optimism and Arbitrum, it is essential to make sure that the L2 sequencer is not down. As a result, the retrieved prices can be stale, even if they appear to be fresh.
## Vulnerability Detail
Both contracts PriceTierVestingSale_2_0 and PriceTierVestingMerkle implement Chainlink Oracles to acquire price information when getting the current vested fraction. If the L2 sequencer goes down, the check for stale data would be passed but in reality, the data would still not be up to date and users will be interacting with stale prices.
## Impact
As a result, the getVestedFraction function would return a tier with a different vested fraction than expected, depending on whether the stale price is higher or lower than the actual price.
In particular, if the retriÐµved price is higher than the actual price, the user would be able to claim more tokens than intended by the protocol.

## Recommendation
Update the _getOraclePrice function in PriceTierVesting.sol by getting data from a sequencer uptime feed:
```solidity
    function _getOraclePrice() private view returns (uint256) {
        (, /*uint80 roundID*/ int256 answer, uint256 startedAt, , ) = /*uint256 updatedAt*/ /*uint80 answeredInRound*/
        sequencerUptimeFeed.latestRoundData();

        // Answer == 0: Sequencer is up
        // Answer == 1: Sequencer is down
        bool isSequencerUp = answer == 0;
        if (!isSequencerUp) {
            revert("Sequencer down");
        }
        (
            uint80 roundID,
            int256 _price,
            uint256 startedAt,
            uint256 timeStamp,
            uint80 answeredInRound
        ) = oracle.latestRoundData();

        require(_price > 0, "negative price");
        require(answeredInRound != 0, "answer == 0");
        require(timeStamp != 0, "round not complete");
        require(answeredInRound >= roundID, "stale price");

        return uint256(_price);
    }
```
