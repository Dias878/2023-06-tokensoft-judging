# Recipients who relinquish voting tokens cannot claim airdrop once fully vested

## Summary

The distributor assumes recipients have fixed ratio between airdrop tokens and voting tokens. If a recipient transfers away any voting tokens, they will be unable to claim the airdrop once they are fully vested.

## Vulnerability Detail

1. Person A receives a token in an airdrop
2. Person B offers person A to buy their "worthless" voting tokens for an attractive price. E.g.: $10 for 0.00001%  of their voting tokens. Person A accepts.
3. Once person A becomes fully vested, they will not be able to claim any further tokens. Further, the token supply will be reduced, potentially increasing the value of Person B's share.

This occurs because of the failure to burn tokens when claiming

## Impact

Bad actors can trick people into losing their airdrop

## Code Snippet

https://github.com/sherlock-audit/2023-06-tokensoft/blob/main/contracts/contracts/claim/abstract/AdvancedDistributor.sol#L94

```solidity
  function _executeClaim(
    address beneficiary,
    uint256 totalAmount
  ) internal virtual override returns (uint256 _claimed) {
    _claimed = super._executeClaim(beneficiary, totalAmount);

    // reduce voting power through ERC20Votes extension
    _burn(beneficiary, tokensToVotes(_claimed));
  }
```


`super.executeClaim` will return the maximum number of claimable tokens.

If there is any shortfall in voting tokens, the call to `_burn` will revert.

Then means, if someone loses a minuscule amount of their voting tokens, once they're fully vested, `_executeClaim` can never run.

Note that all concrete distributors use this code path.

## Tool used

Manual Review

## Recommendation

Several options are available, though none are trivial. There are several comments suggesting the goal to base votes on unclaimed tokens, and not to have these votes be transferable. No separate voting token is needed to do this.
