# claimByMerkleProof uses the distributor's domain, not the beneficiary's domain

## Summary

claimByMerkleProof uses the distributor's domain, not the beneficiary's domain. It thus only works for beneficiary's on the same domain. While there are other ways to claim, they may be more expensive for the claimant

## Vulnerability Detail

From claimByMerkleProof

```solidity
    _verifyMembership(_getLeaf(_beneficiary, _total, domain), _proof);
    // effects
    uint256 claimedAmount = _executeClaim(_beneficiary, _total);

    // interactions
    _settleClaim(_beneficiary, _beneficiary, domain, claimedAmount);
  }
```

Note how it uses the variable `domain`, which is set to `connext.domain()` in the constructor.  It thus only works if the beneficiary's domain is the same as the CrosschainDistributor.

## Impact

The impact is reduced because EOAs can still use `claimBySignature`, while xReceive can still be called on behalf of contracts. However, both of these take more gas, and using xReceive also requires paying the fees of Connext.  Users will thus get less funds than if `claimByMerkleProof` worked correctly.

```solidity
 * 2. `claimByMerkleProof` allows any address to claim funds on behalf of a beneficiary to the Connext domain and address specified in the merkle leaf by providing a merkle proof
