# Uncorrect claimable token amounts and price tiers end time if L2 sequencer goes down

## Summary

Related contracts will not work nomally when l2 sequencer goes down.

## Vulnerability Detail

In the current implementation, several contracts include `PriceTierVestingSale_2_0` and `Distributor` use `block.timestamp` to calculate claimable token amounts and price tiers end time.
However, it's vulnerable when l2 sequencer go down cause that `block.timestamp` is unusable. L2 chains like arbitrum and optimism upgrade their sequencer occasionally, such as the recent [optimism bedrock upgrade](https://cryptopotato.com/optimism-bedrock-upgrade-release-date-revealed/) cause the sequencer can't be able to process transactions for several hours. Or l2 sequencer bug could also cause transactions in stuck, such as [arbitrum sequencer bug](https://beincrypto.com/arbitrum-sequencer-bug-causes-temporary-transaction-pause/). So it's necessary to implement a mechanism to handle this issue in some abnormal conditions. 


## Impact

Several contracts that depend on `block.timestamp` will be not work nomally when l2 sequencer goes down.

## Recommendation

Use chainlink [sequencer up feed](https://docs.chain.link/data-feeds/l2-sequencer-feeds), consider integrating the up-time feed and give the contract extra time to handle such an issue when l2 sequencer goes down.
