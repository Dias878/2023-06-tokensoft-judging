# Incorect calculations for claimable tokens in `adjust` function

## Summary
When a subtraction operation results in a value smaller than the minimum representable value for the data type, it can lead to inaccurate token accounting and misrepresentation of the claimable tokens.
## Vulnerability Details
The `adjust` function allows the owner of the smart contract to adjust the claimable tokens for a specific beneficiary. When the `amount` is negative (decreasing claimable tokens), the function attempts to subtract the value of `diff` from both the total claimable tokens (`total`) and the beneficiary's claimable tokens (`records[beneficiary].total`).
```solidity
function adjust(address beneficiary, int256 amount) external onlyOwner {
    DistributionRecord memory distributionRecord = records[beneficiary];
    require(distributionRecord.initialized, 'must initialize before adjusting');

    uint256 diff = uint256(amount > 0 ? amount : -amount);
    require(diff < type(uint120).max, 'adjustment > max uint120');

    if (amount < 0) {
        // decreasing claimable tokens

        // Potential underflow here
        total -= diff;
        records[beneficiary].total -= uint120(diff);

        // ... (other code)
    } else {
        // increasing claimable tokens

        // ... (other code)
    }

    emit Adjust(beneficiary, amount);
}

```
If the `total` or the `records[beneficiary].total` is smaller than `diff`, an underflow will occur, causing both values to wrap around to the maximum value of `uint120`. This leads to incorrect token accounting and misrepresentation of the claimable tokens.
## Impact
may cause incorrect calculations for claimable tokens, leading to users receiving fewer tokens than they are entitled to. This can result in users losing access to their rightful tokens, leading to dissatisfaction and potential reputational damage to the contract owner.

## Tool used

Manual Review

## Recommendation
Use the imported safeERC20 library
```solidity
if (amount < 0) {
    // Check for underflow possibility
    require(records[beneficiary].total >= diff, 'decrease greater than distributionRecord total');

    total -= diff;
    records[beneficiary].total -= uint120(diff);

    // ... (other code)
}

```
