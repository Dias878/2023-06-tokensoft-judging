# `PriceTierVesting` - `_getOraclePrice` oracle price check is not correct

## Summary
In `_getOraclePrice`, it uses Chainlink's price feed to fetch token's price data, but it's not checking data integrity in a correct way.

## Vulnerability Detail
Checking data staleness is checked using `roundID` and `answeredInRound`, but this is not correct. It has to be checked by interval between `block.timestamp` and `updatedAt` from `lastRoundData()`.
Also it's missing checking sequencer status on L2.

## Impact
When token price goes up and many users claim tokens and sell them, token price will go down.
If price feed is manipulated with old price which is high, other users also will be able to claim more tokens than they are supposed to claim.

## Recommendation
Check L2 sequencer status and data staleness by time interval.
