# inconsistency in control flow of adjust in AdvancedDistributor leads to unpredictable results

## Summary
The adjust function of AdvancedDistributor has inconsistent control flow that doesn't handle token transfers or validate values  equally between the two branches.

## Vulnerability Detail
[In the if-else block of adjust](https://github.com/sherlock-audit/2023-06-tokensoft/blob/main/contracts/contracts/claim/abstract/AdvancedDistributor.sol#L112-L127), if the 'if' branch is executed the difference is transferred to the owner, assuming required conditions are met. Additionally distributor/record totals are validated to ensure they will not underflow after subtracting the difference.

If the 'else' branch is executed, neither of these occur. Tokens are not transferred to the contract, nor is the record total validated for overflow.

## Impact
There is no requirement that tokens be added if increasing token allocation, which can lead to future revert if safeTransfer is called with insufficient balance when a user claims. 

Additionally the adjustment may panic in the case that the record total overflows due to the adjustment.

## Code Snippet
``
    if (amount < 0) {
      // decreasing claimable tokens
      require(total >= diff, 'decrease greater than distributor total');
      require(distributionRecord.total >= diff, 'decrease greater than distributionRecord total');
      total -= diff;
      records[beneficiary].total -= uint120(diff);
      token.safeTransfer(owner(), diff);
      // reduce voting power
      _burn(beneficiary, tokensToVotes(diff));
    } else {
      // increasing claimable tokens
      total += diff;
      records[beneficiary].total += uint120(diff);
      // increase voting pwoer
      _mint(beneficiary, tokensToVotes(diff));
    }
``

## Tool used
Manual Review

## Recommendation
Add the following statements to the 'else' branch:

token.safeTransferFrom(owner(), diff);
require(uint256(records[beneficiary].total) + diff <= type(uint120).max)
