# Failure in xcall Function Call Results in Locked User Relayer Fees

## Summary
There exists a vulnerability in the system where user-paid relayer fees get locked in the `Satellite` contract in case of a failed `xcall` operation. 

## Vulnerability Detail

When an `xcall` operation fails, the relayer fees paid by users get locked in the `Satellite` contract. 
Consequently, users lose access to these funds, and the locked fees remain unclaimed within the contract.


## Impact
This issue could lead to users losing access to their funds.

## Tool used

Manual Review

## Recommendation
According to Connext's documentation (https://docs.connext.network/developers/guides/handling-failed-xcalls#options-for-funds-on-receiver), it is recommended to record the transferId and fee, enabling users to claim the locked funds directly in case of `xcall` failure.
