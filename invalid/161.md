# Potential dos attack when chainlink oracle price dont work normally


## Summary

Implementing Chainlink's latestRoundData() within scope introduces the risk of potential reversion, which could render price queries impossible. Consequently, this may result in a permanent denial of service.

## Vulnerability Detail
PriceTierVesting contract uses chainlink `oracle.latestRoundData` to get the latest price. But from [this article](https://blog.openzeppelin.com/secure-smart-contract-guidelines-the-dangers-of-price-oracles), we can know powerful multisigs can tighten these access controls and cause dos scenarios. So it's recommended to query chainlink price feeds using defensive approach with solidity `try/catch` structure to handle such an issue.

## Impact

Dos the protocol `_getOraclePrice` function and can't return normal price to users.
