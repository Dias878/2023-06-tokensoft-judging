# `CrosschainDistributor._settleClaim` supplies `0` as slippage for the `xcall` which will result in failed cross chain transfer

## Summary
`CrosschainDistributor._settleClaim` supplies `0` as slippage for the `xcall` due to which the cross chain airdrop token transfer will get reverted on either source or destination chain.

## Vulnerability Detail
As per the connext [docs](https://docs.connext.network/smart-contracts/reference/bridge/functions#xcall)
> The adopted assets will be swapped for their local (connext-flavored) asset counterparts (i.e. bridgeable tokens) via the configured AMM if necessary. 

For a successful cross chain transfer of airdrop `token`, the token will first be swapped to a connext flavoured token using the StableSwap pool on source chain, and then on destination chain the connext flavoured token will be swapped back to `token` representation ERC20.

For these swaps a slippage threshold is needed for the `xcall`. As 0 is provided as the slippage threshold, two scenarios can occur:
1. Swap gets reverted on source chain. This will revert the `_settleClaim` call as well, essentially making the cross chain airdrop claiming useless.
2. Swaps gets successful on source chain but gets reverted on destination chain. This will mark the airdrop as claimed for user on source chain but tokens won't arrive to recipient on destination chain. This may or may not be a complete loss of funds, as the Connext contract on destination chain may or may not have mechanisms to update slippage parameter (validating this is oos for this audit).
