# In `_executeClaim`, if the `totalAmount` is greater than initialized before, it could be reverted


## Summary

If the `totalAmount` is greater than `records[benificiary].total`, it means that there's not enough minted tokens to burn.
So in this case, it should be reverted rather than re-initialized.

```solidity
File: contracts/contracts/claim/abstract/Distributor.sol#L66-L85
    function _executeClaim(
        address beneficiary,
        uint256 _totalAmount
    ) internal virtual returns (uint256) {
        uint120 totalAmount = uint120(_totalAmount);

        // effects
        if (records[beneficiary].total != totalAmount) { // @audit here
            // re-initialize if the total has been updated
            _initializeDistributionRecord(beneficiary, totalAmount);
        }
        
        uint120 claimableAmount = uint120(getClaimableAmount(beneficiary));
        require(claimableAmount > 0, 'Distributor: no more tokens claimable right now');

        records[beneficiary].claimed += claimableAmount;
        claimed += claimableAmount;

        return claimableAmount;
    }
File: contracts/contracts/claim/abstract/AdvancedDistributor.sol#L94
    function _executeClaim(
        address beneficiary,
        uint256 totalAmount
    ) internal virtual override returns (uint256 _claimed) {
        _claimed = super._executeClaim(beneficiary, totalAmount);

        // reduce voting power through ERC20Votes extension
        _burn(beneficiary, tokensToVotes(_claimed)); // @audit if totalAmount is greater than minted amount, it could be an insufficient token problem

    }

```

## Impact

If the `totalAmount` is not valid in `executeClaim`, it would not be successful to claim.

## Tool used

Manual Review

## Recommendation

Recommend adding the validation steps if it's valid `totalAmount` or remove that `totalAmount` parameter in the `executeClaim` function and use the recorded totalAmount.
