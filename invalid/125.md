# user can be censored by sequencer, potentially locking his funds indefinitely

## Summary
user can be censored by sequencer, potentially locking his funds indefinitely
## Vulnerability Detail
connext requires that the delegate of an xcall calls `execute` on the destination chain in order to dispurse funds or call calldata. Because the `delegate` has been hard set to address(0) this is not possible.
```solidity
  function initiateClaim(uint256 total, bytes32[] calldata proof) public payable {
    // load values into memory to reduce sloads
    uint32 _distributorDomain = distributorDomain;
    uint32 _domain = domain;

    // Verify the proof before sending cross-chain as a cost + time saving step
    _verifyMembership(keccak256(abi.encodePacked(msg.sender, total, _domain)), proof);

    // Send claim to distributor via crosschain call
    bytes32 transferId = connext.xcall{ value: msg.value }(
      _distributorDomain, // destination domain
      address(distributor), // to
      address(0), // asset
      address(0), // delegate, only required for self-execution + slippage
      0, // total
      0, // slippage
      abi.encodePacked(msg.sender, _domain, total, proof) // data
    );

    // Emit event
    emit ClaimInitiated(transferId, msg.sender, total);
  }
}
```
So in this case the sequencer is in charge and the only way a users funds can reach the destination chain is via the sequencer. Currently the sequencer is centralized to 1, and from connext docs we can see that the sequencer has alot of power.
> The sequencer collects bids from all chains and randomly selects router(s) to fulfill them. Any number of routers can fulfill a single transaction, which is especially useful for large transfers. The sequencer will post batches of these bids to a relayer network to submit them to chain.

A sequencer is an offchain agent who can act maliciously, a sequencer can therefore, censor, or intentionally not include a user tx in the batches that are sent to the relayers. Because the relayers are responsible for submitting the tx to the destination chain, therefore because the sequencer censored a users tx, their funds can be locked indefinitely.

Additionally L2beat has made an article on connext that describes this issue
https://l2beat.com/bridges/projects/connext#validation
>native AMBs that Connext uses allow for passing forged messages and this is not caught by Watchers,
connectors to optimistic rollups (Optimism, Arbitrum) receive a fraudulent message within 7-day fraud-proof window (CRITICAL),
a contract receives a malicious code upgrade. There is no delay on code upgrades (CRITICAL).
Users can be censored if
watchers disconnect certain connectors or pause the whole bridge for no reason.

this is a viable situation that can happen when combining the possible situations, the likelihood increases. This is why i believe this is a high.
## Impact
Users funds may be stuck indefinitely.

## Tool used

Manual Review

## Recommendation
Allow user to specify delegate so trust is not 100% placed on sequencer not acting maliciously.
