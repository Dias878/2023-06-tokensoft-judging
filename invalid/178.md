# Logic error occurs when executing a claim, if the beneficiary was adjusted before.

## Summary
Logic error occurs when executing a claim, if the beneficiary was adjusted before.

## Vulnerability Detail
The owner is able to adjust the quantity claimable by a user, overriding the value in the distribution record by calling the function adjust.

```solidity
  function adjust(address beneficiary, int256 amount) external onlyOwner {
    DistributionRecord memory distributionRecord = records[beneficiary];
    require(distributionRecord.initialized, 'must initialize before adjusting');

    uint256 diff = uint256(amount > 0 ? amount : -amount);
    require(diff < type(uint120).max, 'adjustment > max uint120');

    if (amount < 0) {
      // decreasing claimable tokens
      require(total >= diff, 'decrease greater than distributor total');
      require(distributionRecord.total >= diff, 'decrease greater than distributionRecord total');
      total -= diff;
      records[beneficiary].total -= uint120(diff);
      token.safeTransfer(owner(), diff);
      // reduce voting power
      _burn(beneficiary, tokensToVotes(diff));
    } else {
      // increasing claimable tokens
      total += diff;
      records[beneficiary].total += uint120(diff);
      // increase voting pwoer
      _mint(beneficiary, tokensToVotes(diff));
    }

    emit Adjust(beneficiary, amount);
  }
```
However this adjusting won't work on most of the vesting contracts and can result to the wrong accounting of the Distribution records.

Takes for example the PriceTierVestingSale_2_0, where the total depends on the purchased amount by the beneficiary. Which can lead to the following scenario:
1. Owner adjusts a beneficiary - either decreasing or increasing his claimable tokens.
2. Beneficiary calls the claim function.
3. The distribution record was changed by the owner, but the function will still re-initialize the beneficiary to his purchased amount. Which means that the beneficiary will return to his old values before the adjustment by the owner.

```solidity
  function claim(
    address beneficiary // the address that will receive tokens
  ) external validSaleParticipant(beneficiary) nonReentrant {
    uint256 claimableAmount = getClaimableAmount(beneficiary);
    uint256 purchasedAmount = getPurchasedAmount(beneficiary);

    // effects
    uint256 claimedAmount = super._executeClaim(beneficiary, purchasedAmount);

    // interactions
    super._settleClaim(beneficiary, claimedAmount);
  }
```
```solidity
  function _executeClaim(
    address beneficiary,
    uint256 totalAmount
  ) internal virtual override returns (uint256 _claimed) {
    _claimed = super._executeClaim(beneficiary, totalAmount);

    // reduce voting power through ERC20Votes extension
    _burn(beneficiary, tokensToVotes(_claimed));
  }
```
```solidity
  function _executeClaim(
    address beneficiary,
    uint256 _totalAmount
  ) internal virtual returns (uint256) {
    uint120 totalAmount = uint120(_totalAmount);

    // effects
    if (records[beneficiary].total != totalAmount) {
      // re-initialize if the total has been updated
      _initializeDistributionRecord(beneficiary, totalAmount);
    }
    
    uint120 claimableAmount = uint120(getClaimableAmount(beneficiary));
    require(claimableAmount > 0, 'Distributor: no more tokens claimable right now');

    records[beneficiary].claimed += claimableAmount;
    claimed += claimableAmount;

    return claimableAmount;
  }
```
```solidity
  function _initializeDistributionRecord(
    address beneficiary,
    uint256 _totalAmount
  ) internal virtual {
    uint120 totalAmount = uint120(_totalAmount);

    // Checks
    require(totalAmount <= type(uint120).max, 'Distributor: totalAmount > type(uint120).max');

    // Effects - note that the existing claimed quantity is re-used during re-initialization
    records[beneficiary] = DistributionRecord(true, totalAmount, records[beneficiary].claimed);
    emit InitializeDistributionRecord(beneficiary, totalAmount);
  }
```

## Impact
Wrong accounting of the distribution record occurs, when a claim is executed after adjustment by the owner. As the claim function will re-initialize the beneficiary to his previous distribution record before the adjustment.

## Tool used

Manual Review

## Recommendation
The system should track if the beneficiary was initialized before, and add/sub the difference when re-initializing.

```solidity
  function adjust(address beneficiary, int256 amount) external onlyOwner {
    DistributionRecord memory distributionRecord = records[beneficiary];
    require(distributionRecord.initialized, 'must initialize before adjusting');

    uint256 diff = uint256(amount > 0 ? amount : -amount);
    require(diff < type(uint120).max, 'adjustment > max uint120');

    if (amount < 0) {
      // decreasing claimable tokens
      require(total >= diff, 'decrease greater than distributor total');
      require(distributionRecord.total >= diff, 'decrease greater than distributionRecord total');
      total -= diff;
      records[beneficiary].total -= uint120(diff);
      token.safeTransfer(owner(), diff);
      // reduce voting power
      _burn(beneficiary, tokensToVotes(diff));
       // int value
+     adjusted[beneficiary] = diff;
    } else {
      // increasing claimable tokens
      total += diff;
      records[beneficiary].total += uint120(diff);
      // increase voting pwoer
      _mint(beneficiary, tokensToVotes(diff));

+     adjusted[beneficiary] = diff;
    }

    emit Adjust(beneficiary, amount);
  }
```

Then the adjusted value should be applied before re-initializing

```solidity
  function _executeClaim(
    address beneficiary,
    uint256 _totalAmount
  ) internal virtual returns (uint256) {
    uint120 totalAmount = uint120(_totalAmount);
+   uint120 adjustedAmount = adjusted[beneficiary];

    // effects
+   if (records[beneficiary].total != (totalAmount - uint120(adjustedAmount))) {
      // re-initialize if the total has been updated
      _initializeDistributionRecord(beneficiary, totalAmount);
    }
    
    uint120 claimableAmount = uint120(getClaimableAmount(beneficiary));
    require(claimableAmount > 0, 'Distributor: no more tokens claimable right now');

    records[beneficiary].claimed += claimableAmount;
    claimed += claimableAmount;

    return claimableAmount;
  }
```
