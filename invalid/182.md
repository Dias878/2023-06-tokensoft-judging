# Same address isn't handled properly in crosschain distribution

## Summary

Same addresses to which the tokens are airdropped are confused with each other, causing one recipient to be able to claim for the other.

## Vulnerability Detail

It is a well-known fact that an address on one blockchain can be owned by another entity on another blockchain. A flagship example of this observation is [how Wintermute lost $15m in $OP tokens](https://gov.optimism.io/t/message-to-optimism-community-from-wintermute/2595).

Two different entities could own a wallet of the same address on different blockchains, both could be in a merkle tree of `CrosschainMerkleDistributor`. Because [the accounting of `_executeClaim` and `_initializeDistributionRecord` don't take into account the chain of the recipient](https://github.com/sherlock-audit/2023-06-tokensoft/blob/main/contracts/contracts/claim/abstract/Distributor.sol#L40-L85), all funds claimed by one address will also be accounted for the withdrawal of another.

So, for example, if a linear vesting is set for 3 years, address A on domain X has 300 tokens to be claimed, address A on domain Y has 100 tokens allocated, if the user on domain X withdraws 100 tokens after a year, user on domain Y cannot withdraw any more tokens. Hence, their tokens are stolen.

## Impact

User funds can be stolen if the same address on another chain also has an allocation.

## Code Snippet

```js
  /**
   * @notice Claim tokens for a beneficiary using a merkle proof
   * @dev This method can be called by anyone, but claimed funds will always be sent to the
   * beneficiary address and domain set in the merkle proof.
   * @param _beneficiary The address of the beneficiary
   * @param _total The total claimable amount for this beneficiary
   * @param _proof The merkle proof
   */
  function claimByMerkleProof(
    address _beneficiary,
    uint256 _total,
    bytes32[] calldata _proof
  ) external {
    _verifyMembership(_getLeaf(_beneficiary, _total, domain), _proof);
    // effects
    uint256 claimedAmount = _executeClaim(_beneficiary, _total);

    // interactions
    _settleClaim(_beneficiary, _beneficiary, domain, claimedAmount);
  }
```

## Tool used

Manual Review

## Recommendation

For cross-chain distributors, use a records mapping that not only takes the address as an argument, but also the domain of the address.
