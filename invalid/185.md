# initializeDistributionRecord external fn could be dangerous due to the transferable Erc20Votes Tokens

## Summary
Eligible users to claim their airdrop can _mint Erc20Votes via initializeDistributionRecord external function while they can bypass the merkleProof test and then they can transfer their own Erc20Votes tokens since its open to every token owners.

## Vulnerability Detail
even with owner functions such as "adjust", after transfering Erc20Votes tokens, owner (admin or etc.) cant decrease and adjust the Erc20Votes tokens via burning them since adjust function do:
```solidity
      records[beneficiary].total -= uint120(diff);
```
and this will be failed because user didn’t inited its total.

## Impact
Maybe there wouldn’t  be a big issue, but even after setting new Token for cross-chain contracts, and changing everything about merkleProofs and generating new Root, the user that gets the transferred  Erc20Votes Tokens can participate for any kind of events, (if conditions only checks the Erc20Votes token owner), and this would be dangerous since there is no owner functions that can change the game.

One other dangerous part of this issue is that, the eligible user who sent his/her Erc20Votes tokens, is now immune from adjusting that part of amount cause even if we want to decrease his/her total, it will be failed since the total is not equal with the balance of user vote tokens, so the function _burn in adjust funtion will not be worked.
