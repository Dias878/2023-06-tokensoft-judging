# Useres whose `DistributionRecord` have not been initated have no voting power

## Summary

Voting tokens are only minted when the `DistributionRecord` of a recipient is initiated. For Distributors using merkle proofs this initiation of the `DistributionRecord` does not happen automatically leading to potential skewing of the weights of votes

## Vulnerability Detail
If a user `DistributionRecord` has not been initiated yet, he has no voting tokens to his name and also the overall number of voting tokens does not correspond to the total existing voting power. This makes the weight of the already minted voting tokens higher (e.g. user should have 25% of voting power but only 50% of the voting tokens have been minted => user has 50% of voting power).
Also votes where a minimum % of voting power should participate might go through even though the required % is not met. (e.g. 50% of voting power should partake in a vote => in the example above threshold would be reached if the user that should hold only 25% of the voting power votes) 

## Impact

Voting power of existing tokens is inflated compared to the power they should have and less people have more decision making power

## Tool used

Manual Review

## Recommendation

Ensure that all `DistributionRecord` are initiated when deploying the distributor.
