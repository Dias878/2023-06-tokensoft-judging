# IVT token is not burned after claim

## Summary
The function  **BasicDistributor.claim** inherits the wrong implementations 
## Vulnerability Detail

In **BasicDistributor.claim** `super._executeClaim.` calls the **Distributor.excuteClaim** function which doesnâ€™t burn  the IVT 

## Impact
The user can still vote  even after he claimed his tokens
