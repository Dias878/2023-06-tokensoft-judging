# Re-initializing the beneficiary if the total has been updated doesn't mint any additional voting power to the beneficiary.

## Summary
Re-initializing the beneficiary if the total has been updated doesn't mint any additional voting power to the beneficiary.

## Vulnerability Detail
When executing a claim, the function re-initialize the beneficiary if the total has been updated, since the last time the beneficiary was initialized.
- The problem here is that the function initializes the benificary, but doesn't actually mint any additional voting power to it.

```solidity
  function _executeClaim(
    address beneficiary,
    uint256 _totalAmount
  ) internal virtual returns (uint256) {
    uint120 totalAmount = uint120(_totalAmount);

    // effects
    if (records[beneficiary].total != totalAmount) {
      // re-initialize if the total has been updated
      _initializeDistributionRecord(beneficiary, totalAmount);
    }
    
    uint120 claimableAmount = uint120(getClaimableAmount(beneficiary));
    require(claimableAmount > 0, 'Distributor: no more tokens claimable right now');

    records[beneficiary].claimed += claimableAmount;
    claimed += claimableAmount;

    return claimableAmount;
  }
```
```solidity
  function _initializeDistributionRecord(
    address beneficiary,
    uint256 _totalAmount
  ) internal virtual {
    uint120 totalAmount = uint120(_totalAmount);

    // Checks
    require(totalAmount <= type(uint120).max, 'Distributor: totalAmount > type(uint120).max');

    // Effects - note that the existing claimed quantity is re-used during re-initialization
    records[beneficiary] = DistributionRecord(true, totalAmount, records[beneficiary].claimed);
    emit InitializeDistributionRecord(beneficiary, totalAmount);
  }
```
For example, take the PriceTierVestingSale_2_0 contract.
- The total depends on the purchased amount by the beneficiary.
- If the beneficiary purchase more tokens, his purchased amount increases.
- The beneficiary calls the claim function.
- The claim function will re-initalize his beneficiary to the current purchased amount but won't mint the additional voting power earned by the beneficiary depending on how much more tokens the beneficiary purchased.

## Impact
Loss of voting power duo to the contract initializing the beneficiary without minting any additional voting power to it.

## Tool used

Manual Review

## Recommendation
Hard to do a fix here as a lot of vesting contracts depend on the Distributor contract, and few of them have different logic. 

- E.g. the BasicDistributor contract doesn't have this issue, as the total is adjusted by the owner.
