# `onlyConnext()` Modifier's Checks Are Not Sufficient, There should be checks for `Origin Domain` and `Source Contract`

## Summary
`onlyConnext()` not validated Cross-Chain call properly

## Vulnerability Detail
According to `Connext` docs

 A modifier for authenticated calls.
    This is an important security consideration. If the target contract function should be authenticated, it must check three things:
   *    1) The originating call comes from the expected origin domain.
   *    2) The originating call comes from the expected source contract.
   *    3) The call to this contract comes from Connext.
   

So there should be checks for `Origin Domain` and `Source Contract` address check with `Connext Address` check

```solidity

  modifier onlyConnext() { // @audit-issue not validated properly refer above issue
-    require(msg.sender == address(connext), '!connext');

+   require(
+      _origin == <ORIGIN_DOMAIN> &&
+        _originSender == <SOURCE_CONTRACT_ADDRESS> &&
+        msg.sender == address(connext), '!connext');
    _;
  }
```

Manual Review

## Recommendation
Should implement
```solidity

  modifier onlyConnext() { // @audit-issue not validated properly refer above issue
-    require(msg.sender == address(connext), '!connext');

+   require(
+      _origin == <ORIGIN_DOMAIN> &&
+        _originSender == <SOURCE_CONTRACT_ADDRESS> &&
+        msg.sender == address(connext), '!connext');
    _;
  }
```
