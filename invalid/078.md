# Missing deadline check when signing message

## Summary

Missing deadline check when sign message. 

## Vulnerability Detail

In `CrosschainMerkleDistributor.sol` we have `claimBySignature()`. This function claims tokens for a beneficiary using a merkle proof and beneficiary signature. 
But there is no deadline check when signing a message.

```solidity
129:    bytes32 _signed = keccak256( 
130:      abi.encodePacked(_recipient, _recipientDomain, _beneficiary, _beneficiaryDomain, _total)
131:    );
132:    address recovered = _recoverSignature(_signed, _signature);
```

Signatures signed by users should always have an expiration or timestamp deadline, such that after that time the signature is no longer valid.

## Impact

If there is no signature expiration, a user by signing a message is effectively granting a "lifetime license".

Manual Review

## Recommendation

The signature message should always include an expiration timestamp. Add a deadline check when signing a message.
