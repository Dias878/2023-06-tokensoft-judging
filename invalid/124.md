# Hard-coded delegate will cause a loss of funds for the user

## Summary
Hard-coded delegate brings up security concerns for a user, this will cause a loss of funds for the user.
## Vulnerability Detail
in satellite.sol contract the delegate is hard-coded to address 0
```solidity
  function initiateClaim(uint256 total, bytes32[] calldata proof) public payable {
    // load values into memory to reduce sloads
    uint32 _distributorDomain = distributorDomain;
    uint32 _domain = domain;

    // Verify the proof before sending cross-chain as a cost + time saving step
    _verifyMembership(keccak256(abi.encodePacked(msg.sender, total, _domain)), proof);

    // Send claim to distributor via crosschain call
    bytes32 transferId = connext.xcall{ value: msg.value }(
      _distributorDomain, // destination domain
      address(distributor), // to
      address(0), // asset
      address(0), // delegate, only required for self-execution + slippage
      0, // total
      0, // slippage
      abi.encodePacked(msg.sender, _domain, total, proof) // data
    );

    // Emit event
    emit ClaimInitiated(transferId, msg.sender, total);
  }
}
```
from the connext docs
https://docs.connext.network/smart-contracts/reference/bridge/functions#xcall
> Delegate: An address on destination domain that has rights to update slippage tolerance, retry transactions, or revert back to origin in the event that a transaction fails at the destination.

since the delegate is set to address 0, in the event that a transactions fails at the destination, the user will not be able to revert to origin, locking his funds.

## Impact
users funds will be locked and be unable to be retrieved

Manual Review

## Recommendation
allow user to set delegate address.
