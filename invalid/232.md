# In `PriceTierVesting` tokens are only claimable as long as the current oracle price is above the price of the `tier`

## Summary

In `PriceTierVesting` tokens the `vestedFraction` is calculated based on the current oracle price. This means that tokens get locked again if the oracle price was above the `tierprice` before and goes below the `tierprice` again

## Vulnerability Detail

In `PriceTierVesting` the `vestedFraction` depends on the price of the token. If the price passes the threshold of the tier, the tokens of the tier are unlocked. The problem is that once the price falls below the tier price again, the tokens are locked again since the `vestedFraction` is based on the current oracle price. This means that if the price of the token crosses a price threshold for a short time and falls back under the threshold again, only users will be able to claim their tokens that are aware of this price increase and manage to claim their tokens while the price is above the `tierPrice`. All other users that only check the price rarely will not be able to claim their tokens.  

## Impact

Users that are not monitoring the token price permanently will miss out on the opportunity to claim their tokens and thereby might miss out on financial gains resulting from selling the tokens at a favourable price

Manual Review

## Recommendation

To make the unlocking process more fair consider implementing a variable that tracks the max price of the token users have claimed with. Comparing this max variable with the current oracle price and using the bigger one to calculate the `vestingFraction` would make sure that all tranches are unlocked equally and fairly for all recipients, not favoring the users that have the technical know how to set up a monitoring program for the price
