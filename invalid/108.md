# Adjust function reverts when amount is exactly type(uint120).max

## Summary
The adjust function from the ```AdvancedDistributor.sol``` will revert if the amount in the parameter = type(uint120).max.

## Vulnerability Detail

In the ```Distributor.sol``` line 54 within the ```_initializeDistributionRecord``` function, the require statement verifies if the total amount is <= type(uint120).max, this is fine as the ```totalAmount``` can have this value. However, in the ```AdvancedDistributor.sol``` within the ```adjust``` function, it will revert if diff = type(uint120).max, meaning the function won't excecute when it should in this specific instant.  

## Impact
The impact is that the code remains inconsistent with one another and across contracts, meaning if the owner wants to adjust the claimable quantity when the total is of type(uint120).max, it will revert in this specific instance. This is why I think medium severity is sufficient for this vulnerability

## Tool used

Manual Review

## Recommendation
The checks should remain consistent, the check should be ```require(diff <= type(uint120).max, 'adjustment > max uint120');``` within the ```adjust``` function.
