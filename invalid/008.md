# Potential Over-claiming in claim function.

## Summary
The claim function does not check if the totalAmount passed matches the amount set when the distribution record for the beneficiary was initialized. This could allow incorrect claims to be made.

## Vulnerability Detail
Suppose a beneficiary was initialized with an amount of 100 tokens.
The beneficiary (or any actor knowing the beneficiary's merkle proof) could call the claim function with the totalAmount parameter set to 200.
Without a check to ensure the totalAmount matches the amount set during initialization, the beneficiary could claim 200 tokens instead of their allocated 100.

## Impact
Absence of Validation for totalAmount in the claim Function Leading to Potential Over-claiming

## Tool used
Manual Review

## Recommendation
A check should be added to the claim function to ensure that totalAmount is equal to the amount initially set for the beneficiary in their distribution record. The function could first retrieve the amount from the distribution record and compare it to the totalAmount
```solidity
require(amountFromRecord == totalAmount, "Incorrect total amount");
```
If it's stored in a mapping, for example, it could be `amountFromRecord = distributionRecord[beneficiary].amount;`
