# Funds may be locked

## Summary

## Vulnerability Detail
If the recipient address is a contract not capable of receiving Ether (e.g., a contract without a payable fallback function), the sweepNative() and sweepNative(uint256 amount) functions would fail, potentially locking Ether in the contract.

## Impact
```solidity
(bool success, ) = recipient.call{value: amount}("");
require(success, "Transfer failed.");
```

If the recipient is another contract, and that contract doesn't have a payable fallback or receive function, it won't be able to accept the incoming Ether. In such a case, the call function would fail, i.e., success would be false, and the subsequent require statement would cause the whole transaction to revert.

If this contract doesn't have any other function to transfer out the Ether (which it doesn't, as per the provided code), the Ether would be essentially locked inside it, with no way to move it out

## Tool used
Manual Review

## Recommendation
Thefunction canbe restricted to onlyOwner to prevent unauthorized sweeping of the contract's Ether.
