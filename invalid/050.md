# Call return not check in Cross-Chain Token Transfer

## Summary

The ```_settleClaim``` function in the ```CrosschainDistributor.sol``` contract contains an issue where the return value of the ```connext.xcall``` call is not properly checked, leading to potential loss of funds and incorrect contract state if the cross-chain transfer fails for any reason.

## Vulnerability Detail

In the ```_settleClaim``` function, the ```xcall``` to Connext is used to perform a cross-chain token transfer:

```solidity
function _settleClaim(
  // ...

  ) internal virtual {

  bytes32 id;  

  id = connext.xcall(
    // ... xcall parameters
  );
  
  emit CrosschainClaim(id, ...); 

}
```

The ```id``` returned from ```xcall``` represents the transaction hash of the initiated cross-chain transfer. This value is not validated to check if the ```xcall``` succeeded or failed.

If the ```xcall``` fails for any reason like an invalid recipient address, chain issues, or contract bugs, the transfer will revert. However, the ```CrosschainClaim.sol``` event will still be emitted incorrectly indicating success.

Furthermore, the claimed amount for the beneficiary may still be wrongly incremented in storage, corrupting the vesting accounting.

## Impact

This vulnerability can lead to:

1.     **Loss of funds** if the cross-chain transfer fails but tokens are still withdrawn from the origin chain balance
2.     **Inaccurate accounting** if claimed amounts are incremented without successful transfer
3.     **Reputational damage** due to emitting transfer success events even if failed
4.     **Contract disruption** if unhandled transfer failures pile up and contract needs to be paused/fixed

### CrosschainDistributor.sol
https://github.com/sherlock-audit/2023-06-tokensoft/blob/main/contracts/contracts/claim/abstract/CrosschainDistributor.sol#L68C3-L89C4

```solidity
  function _settleClaim(
    address _beneficiary,
    address _recipient,
    uint32 _recipientDomain,
    uint256 _amount
  ) internal virtual {
    bytes32 id;
    if (_recipientDomain == 0 || _recipientDomain == domain) {
      token.safeTransfer(_recipient, _amount);
    } else {
      id = connext.xcall(
        _recipientDomain, // destination domain
        _recipient, // to
        address(token), // asset
        _recipient, // delegate, only required for self-execution + slippage
        _amount, // amount
        0, // slippage -- assumes no pools on connext
        bytes('') // calldata
      );
    }
    emit CrosschainClaim(id, _beneficiary, _recipient, _recipientDomain, _amount);
  }
```
