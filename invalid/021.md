# `AdvancedDistributor` - voting tokens should not be burnt or minted in `adjust` function

## Summary
In `adjust` function, voting tokens should not be burnt or minted.

## Vulnerability Detail
When adjustment amount is negative, total amount is reduced so users can claim less tokens meaning they will have less voting power. If voting tokens are burnt in `adjust` function, it causes double burning. More seriously, `adjust` will revert when user claimed less than adjustment amount because they don't have enough voting tokens to burn.

When adjustment amount is positive, total amount is increased so users can claim more tokens meaning they will have more voting power. If voting tokens are minted in `adjust` function, it causes double minting.

## Impact
Voting tokens are double minted/burnt and `adjust` revers based on how much user has claimed.
