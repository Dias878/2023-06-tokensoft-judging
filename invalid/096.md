# Unattended Execution could lead to unclaimable Tokens Vulnerability in _initializeDistributionRecord() Function

## Summary
During the audit of the smart contract code, a vulnerability was identified in the function `_initializeDistributionRecord()`. The vulnerability pertains to the incorrect handling of beneficiary records reinitialization, which could lead to several potential impacts. One notable scenario is when the constructor of BasicDistributor is called with duplicated `_recipients` elements, resulting in multiple invocations of `_initializeDistributionRecord()` for the same beneficiary. This, in turn, can lead to unintended executions.

## Vulnerability Detail
The issue lies in the `_initializeDistributionRecord()` function inside `AdvancedDistributor`. This function first calls `_initializeDistributionRecord()` inside `Distributor` and subsequently mints `tokensToVotes()` for the beneficiary. The problem arises when the minted tokensToVotes remain unburned while reinitializing the beneficiary records with a new `_totalAmount`.

Specifically, the line `records[beneficiary] = DistributionRecord(true, totalAmount, records[beneficiary].claimed);` inside the `_initializeDistributionRecord()` function in `Distributor` replaces the beneficiary records for any new entry of beneficiary `_totalAmount`. However, this replacement only considers the beneficiary's claimed amount and the new `_totalAmount`, disregarding any previously minted `tokensToVotes`. Consequently, this oversight may lead to the creation of unclaimable `tokensToVotes()`.

## Impact
The identified vulnerability can have the following impacts:

- Beneficiaries could end up with more voting power than what their existing records indicate, resulting in a discrepancy in voting influence.
- Reinitialized beneficiary records may lead to unclaimable amounts due to the neglect of the previously minted tokens during the reinitialization process.

## Tool Used
The audit was performed manually with the aid of hardhat test.

## Recommendation
To address this vulnerability, I recommend implementing a solution that takes into account both the previous totalAmount and the previously claimed amount when reinitializing any beneficiary record. Alternatively, burn any previously minted tokensToVotes() before proceeding with the reinitialization process. By adopting these measures, the potential risks associated with the identified vulnerability can be mitigated effectively.
