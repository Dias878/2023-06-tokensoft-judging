# Hard coded slippage will cause a loss of funds for a user

## Summary
Hard coded slippage will cause a loss of funds for a user
## Vulnerability Detail
Slippage is the difference between the expected price of an order and the price when the order actually executes. If the slippage tolerance is set too low, a transaction will not execute. If the slippage tolerance is set too high, users will lose money for paying more per token than intended during swaps.

we can observe the hard coded slippage in the `satellite.sol` contract
```solidity
  function initiateClaim(uint256 total, bytes32[] calldata proof) public payable {
    // load values into memory to reduce sloads
    uint32 _distributorDomain = distributorDomain;
    uint32 _domain = domain;

    // Verify the proof before sending cross-chain as a cost + time saving step
    _verifyMembership(keccak256(abi.encodePacked(msg.sender, total, _domain)), proof);

    // Send claim to distributor via crosschain call
    bytes32 transferId = connext.xcall{ value: msg.value }(
      _distributorDomain, // destination domain
      address(distributor), // to
      address(0), // asset
      address(0), // delegate, only required for self-execution + slippage
      0, // total
      0, // slippage
      abi.encodePacked(msg.sender, _domain, total, proof) // data
    );

    // Emit event
    emit ClaimInitiated(transferId, msg.sender, total);
  }
}
```
as we can he the slippage will always be set to 0 and user can not specify slippage.

from connext docs: 
https://docs.connext.network/integrations/guides/handling-failed-xcalls#high-slippage-conditions
> When tokens are bridged through Connext, slippage can impact the xcall during the swap on origin or destination. If slippage is too high on the origin swap, the xcall will just revert

## Impact
swaps can occur with very high slippage which will cause a loss of funds for a user, and slippage can impact the xcall during the swap on origin or destination. If slippage is too high on the origin swap, the xcall will just revert

Manual Review

## Recommendation
allow user to specify slippage.
