# Excessive Storage Usage

## Summary
Excessive Storage Usage by a loop in a function in a contract connected to PriceTierVestingMerkle.sol and PriceTierVestingSale_2_0.sol contracts
## Vulnerability Detail
 PriceTierVesting(...)  access modifier used in https://github.com/sherlock-audit/2023-06-tokensoft/blob/main/contracts/contracts/claim/PriceTierVestingMerkle.sol#L26 and https://github.com/sherlock-audit/2023-06-tokensoft/blob/main/contracts/contracts/claim/PriceTierVestingSale_2_0.sol#L41 which is in connection to the abstract PriceTierVesting.sol Contract @ https://github.com/sherlock-audit/2023-06-tokensoft/blob/main/contracts/contracts/claim/abstract/PriceTierVesting.sol#L27C13-L27C13 . 

The function called in it contructor at L27
```solidity
27.   _setPriceTiers(_start, _end, _oracle, _tiers); 
```
uses a loop at https://github.com/sherlock-audit/2023-06-tokensoft/blob/main/contracts/contracts/claim/abstract/PriceTierVesting.sol#L97-L120

The reassignment of highestPrice & highestFraction at L113 and 114 would use excessive storage when what is just needed is _tiers[i].price and _tiers[i].vestedFraction of the last content of the array that is being looped through.
```solidity
107.            uint128 highestPrice = 0;
108.		uint128 highestFraction = 0;
109.
110.		for (uint256 i = 0; i < _tiers.length; ) {
			...
113.			highestPrice = _tiers[i].price;
114.			highestFraction = _tiers[i].vestedFraction;
                        ...
121.		}
```
## Impact
Excessive Storage Usage by highestPrice and highestFraction variables would affect smooth contract operation especially when looping through a large _tiers array data.

## Tool used

Manual Review

## Recommendation
The reassignment of highestPrice & highestFraction at L113 & L114 should be removed and placed outside the loop and assigned directly to the last content of the _tiers array. The new code should look like this 
```solidity
107.            uint128 highestPrice = 0;
108.		uint128 highestFraction = 0;
109.
110.		for (uint256 i = 0; i < _tiers.length; ) {
			...
121.		}
122.            highestPrice = _tiers[_tiers.length-1].price;
123.		highestFraction = _tiers[_tiers.length-1].vestedFraction;
