# `AdvancedDistributor` - Wrong implementation of `adjust` function

## Summary
In `AdvancedDistributor` contract, `adjust` function is implemented in a wrong way.

## Vulnerability Detail
In `_executeClaim` function of `Distributor`, it compares old amount and new amount, if they are different, it's reset to the new amount, and the claimable amount is defined by new amount.
This being said, modifying the `total` field of a beneficiary's record in `adjust` function has no effect for restricting users' claimable amount.

## Impact
Users' actual claimable amount will not change when `adjust` is called.

Manual Review

## Recommendation
Based on the purpose of `adjust` function, either modify `claimed` or do not update amount in `_executeClaim` function.
