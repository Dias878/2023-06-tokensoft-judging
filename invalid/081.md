# zero slippage makes claiming impossible in contracts deriving from CrossChainDistributor.sol

## Summary
The _settleClaim function in CrossChainDistributor is used in each of the crosschain distributor contracts and has a flaw that makes claiming of vested tokens impossible in all derived contracts.

## Vulnerability Detail
[slippage parameter of connext.xcall is set to 0](https://github.com/sherlock-audit/2023-06-tokensoft/blob/main/contracts/contracts/claim/abstract/CrosschainDistributor.sol#L84), according to [connext docs](https://docs.connext.network/developers/reference/contracts/calls) this is the slippage tolerance in bps willing to be tolerated. But there will invariably be slippage, especially in low liquidity pools, resulting in revert and disabling _settleClaim used to claim tokens.

## Impact
Users are unable to claim their tokens crosschain despite having valid vesting.

## Code Snippet
``function _settleClaim(
    address _beneficiary,
    address _recipient,
    uint32 _recipientDomain,
    uint256 _amount
  ) internal virtual {
    bytes32 id;
    if (_recipientDomain == 0 || _recipientDomain == domain) {
      token.safeTransfer(_recipient, _amount);
    } else {
      id = connext.xcall(
        _recipientDomain, // destination domain
        _recipient, // to
        address(token), // asset
        _recipient, // delegate, only required for self-execution + slippage
        _amount, // amount
        0, // slippage -- assumes no pools on connext
        bytes('') // calldata
      );
    }
    emit CrosschainClaim(id, _beneficiary, _recipient, _recipientDomain, _amount);
  }
``

## Tool used
Manual Review

## Recommendation
Set a nonzero slippage, perhaps dynamically set through an input parameter based on available liquidity.
