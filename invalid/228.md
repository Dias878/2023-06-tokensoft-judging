# PriceTierVesting will use the wrong price if the Chainlink registry returns price outside min/max range

## Summary
PriceTierVesting will use the wrong price if the Chainlink registry returns price outside min/max range

## Vulnerability Detail
Chainlink aggregators have a built in circuit breaker if the price of an asset goes outside of a predetermined price band. The result is that if an asset experiences a huge drop in value (i.e. LUNA crash) the price of the oracle will continue to return the minPrice instead of the actual price of the asset. This would allow user to continue borrowing with the asset but at the wrong price. This is exactly what happened to [Venus on BSC when LUNA imploded](https://rekt.news/venus-blizz-rekt/).

## Impact

The wrong price may be returned in the event of a market crash. An adversary will then be able to borrow against the wrong price and incur bad debt to the protocol.

## Tool used

Manual Review

## Recommendation

Implement the proper check for each asset. **It must revert in the case of bad price**.

```solidity
function _getOraclePrice() private view returns (uint256) {
		(
			uint80 roundID,
			int256 _price,
			uint256 startedAt,
			uint256 timeStamp,
			uint80 answeredInRound
		) = oracle.latestRoundData();
                require(price >= minPrice && price <= maxPrice, "invalid price"); 
		require(_price > 0, "negative price");
		require(answeredInRound != 0, "answer == 0");
		require(timeStamp != 0, "round not complete");
		require(answeredInRound >= roundID, "stale price");

		return uint256(_price);
	}
```
