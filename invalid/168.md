# getVestedFraction can break in continuous vesting

## Summary
getVestedFraction can break in continuous vesting because of time.
## Vulnerability Detail
the current implementation says
```solidity
uint256 delayedTime = time- getFairDelayTime(beneficiary);
``` 
but getFairDelayTime can be greater than time which will always revert becuase of underflow. this depends on the maxdelaytime which can be upto uint160 max . the higher the maxdelaytime the lower the distancePerSecond
```solidity
  function getFairDelayTime(address user) public view returns (uint256) {
    if (distancePerSecond == 0) {
      // there is no delay: all addresses may participate immediately
      return 0;
    }

    // calculate a distance between the random value and the user's address using the XOR distance metric (c.f. Kademlia)
    uint160 distance = uint160(user) ^ randomValue;

    // return the delay (seconds)
    return distance / distancePerSecond;
  }
}
``` 
and from the code distancePerSecond  divides distance  that is a big number making return seconds higher than time

## Impact
stoppage of claiming of token till it is changed but owner can renounce ownership.

## Tool used

Manual Review

## Recommendation
check that returned seconds is not greater than time before subtracting .
