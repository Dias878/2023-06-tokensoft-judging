# `CrosschainDistributor` - Wrong implementation of `_allowConnext`

## Summary
In CrosschainDistributor, `_allowConnect` function is used to set the token allowance to Connext, but it won't be working at all because of `safeApprove`.

## Vulnerability Detail
`SafeERC20`'s `safeApprove` function only reset the allowance to zero or set allowance when previous allowance is not zero.
It will revert when it tries to set an allowance and previous allowance is not zero.

There's two issues in `CrosschainDistributor` surrounding this problem:

1. `_setTotal` will be called multiple times whenever there's lack of tokens in the contract, and at the moment of function call, there will still be remaining allowance to `Connext`, which means that `safeApprove` will revert, which will result in the revert of `_setTotal` function.
2. When `_setToken` is called, it tries to set the token allowance to `Connext`, but if it already has a bit of token allowance already, it will also revert, so `_setToken` function will not work.

## Impact
If `_setTotal` function doesn't work, the owner will not be able to increase distributed token amounts, which will cause users not be able to claim rewards too.
Also for `_setToken` function doesn't work, the owner will not be able to update the reward token forever.

## Tool used

Manual Review

## Recommendation
In `_allowConnext` function, call `safeApprove` with zero to reset, and then call again to set a value.
