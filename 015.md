# Unsafe downcasting of distribution record total from `uint256` to `uint120` will lead to user being unable to claim most of funds

## Summary

`Distributor` implementation tracks the total owed to each user as `uint120`:

https://github.com/sherlock-audit/2023-06-tokensoft/blob/main/contracts/contracts/interfaces/IDistributor.sol#L13-L17

However, the amounts passed to smart contract functions and stored in merkle tree are `uint256`. Moreover, the amounts are downcasted from `uint256` to `uint120` without overflow checks, making it possible to provide values higher than uint120 which will silently pass but will make claimable amount by users to be much smaller than specified, effectively leading to users loss of funds.

## Vulnerability Detail

When `_initializeDistributionRecord` is called (with `uint256 _totalAmount`), this `_totalAmount` is downcasted to `uint120` and result is compared with `type(uint120).max`, however the check will always pass, because the value which is being compared is already downcasted and will always be less or equal than max `uint120` value:

https://github.com/sherlock-audit/2023-06-tokensoft/blob/main/contracts/contracts/claim/abstract/Distributor.sol#L47-L54

The `require` will always pass, because downcasted `totalAmount` (instead of `_totalAmount`) is compared against max `uint120`.

`_executeClaim` will also pass as `_totalAmount` is downcasted to `uint120` without any checks allowing it to proceed successfully:

https://github.com/sherlock-audit/2023-06-tokensoft/blob/main/contracts/contracts/claim/abstract/Distributor.sol#L66-L76

`getClaimableAmount` will use the distribution record, which has downcasted `total`:

https://github.com/sherlock-audit/2023-06-tokensoft/blob/main/contracts/contracts/claim/abstract/Distributor.sol#L116-L127

As such, claimable amount will allow to claim max amount equal to distribution record's `total`.

## Impact

If user's airdrop amounts are higher than `uint120`, they will be unable to claim most of it.

For example, if airdrop token has 30 decimals, max `uint120` will be `1329228` of this token. If the user is airdropped `1400000` of the token, this total will be downcasted to `70772`, so the user will be able to max claim only `70772` instead of `1400000`, effectively losing these funds. Since this can only happen when airdropped amount is very high (or for token with large number of decimals), which is a rare situation, the assessed severity is Medium.

## Tool used

Manual Review

## Recommendation

Consider using safe downcasting library (`SafeCast`) or alternatives to do correct check that the amount can be downcasted safely (which checks that amount is less or equan than max uint120 before the downcast).

Alternatively, just check the correct `_totalAmount` instead of downcasted `totalAmount` in `_initializeDistributionRecord`:
```solidity
  function _initializeDistributionRecord(
    address beneficiary,
    uint256 _totalAmount
  ) internal virtual {
    uint120 totalAmount = uint120(_totalAmount);

    // Checks
    require(_totalAmount <= type(uint120).max, 'Distributor: totalAmount > type(uint120).max');
```
