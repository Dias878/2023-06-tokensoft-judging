# The `xcall` made in the function `_settleClaim` is not configured correctly which will make the transaction revert all the time

## Summary
The `_settleClaim` function in `CrosschainDistributor.sol` is used to transfer ERC20 tokens to the recipient, but if the `_recipientDomain` is not equal to the `domain` the function will call `xcall` on the `connext` contract, call which will revert all the time because of the bad configuration
## Vulnerability Detail
In the `Connext` documentation it is specified that there are every time `xcall` is called the user need to provide the `Relayer Fee` which is  ***A fee charged by relayers on top of normal gas costs in exchange for providing a meta-transaction service.*** https://docs.connext.network/developers/guides/estimating-fees.
It is also stated that there are 2 `xcall` methods, the difference between them is that one is an overloaded version which has `_relayerFee ` parameter after the `__callData` parameter, which is used to specify in which asset you want to pay the `Relayer Fee`. If `_relayerFee ` is not specified then the it will assume that the fee is paid in the native token of the chain as can be seen per documentation https://docs.connext.network/developers/reference/contracts/calls#xcall.
The problem is that the `__settleClaim` function which call `xcall` doesn't provide any `_relayerFee` parameter and neither provide any `value` to the function to pay for the `Relayer Fee` as can be seen here https://github.com/sherlock-audit/2023-06-tokensoft/blob/main/contracts/contracts/claim/abstract/CrosschainDistributor.sol#L78-L86 which will make the call revert all the time since no fee is paid.
## Impact
This will hurt the whole cross-chain distribution process since calling `xcall` would revert all the time.

Manual Review

## Recommendation
Consider adding the the `relayersFee` variable in as `value` in case you want to pay in the native token or use the overloaded `xcall` version if not. A good example of how to do a simple transfer of an asset between different chains can also be found in the documentation https://docs.connext.network/developers/examples/simple-bridge, I will leave you the simple version here
```solidity
connext.xcall{value: relayerFee}(
      destinationDomain, // _destination: Domain ID of the destination chain
      recipient,         // _to: address receiving the funds on the destination
      token,             // _asset: address of the token contract
      msg.sender,        // _delegate: address that can revert or forceLocal on destination
      amount,            // _amount: amount of tokens to transfer
      slippage,          // _slippage: the maximum amount of slippage the user will accept in BPS (e.g. 30 = 0.3%)
      bytes("")          // _callData: empty bytes because we're only sending funds
    );
