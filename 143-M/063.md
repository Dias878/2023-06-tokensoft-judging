# The cross-chain claimed tokens are never transferred to the Beneficiary wallet.

## Summary

The cross-chain claimed tokens are never transferred to the Beneficiary wallet.

## Vulnerability Detail

In the `_settleClaim()` function, the settlement of claimed tokens to a different domain involves calling `connext.xcall()` without paying any relayer fee.

```solidity
function _settleClaim(...) {
	...
    id = connext.xcall(
      _recipientDomain, // destination domain
      _recipient, // to
      address(token), // asset
      _recipient, // delegate, only required for self-execution + slippage
      _amount, // amount
      0, // slippage -- assumes no pools on connext
      bytes('') // calldata
    );
    ...
}
```

According to the documentation at https://connext.notion.site/External-Spec-Crosschain-Airdrops-1ee0e3def3314b61bf954d44d19640d7, there is no information provided regarding an off-chain service that supports the required relayer fee payment, leading to an unresolved issue.

## Impact

The claimed tokens are never transferred to the Beneficiary wallet on the destination chain. The contract is rendered useless without the help of an extra fee payment service (which does not exist according to documentation).

## Tool used

Manual Review

## Recommendation

It is recommended to pay the relayer fee with the native asset or the transferred asset based on the suggestion provided in the [Connext documentation](https://docs.connext.network/developers/guides/estimating-fees#estimating-relayer-fees). This would ensure the proper execution of the destination chain transaction.
