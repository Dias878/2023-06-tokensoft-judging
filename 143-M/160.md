# `xcall` transfer may never succeed because of inability to increase relayer fees

## Summary

In case of cross-chain claims, when using `CrosschainDistributor`, the `xcall` token transfer has zero slippage and zero relayer fees paid. Hence, the transfer may fail to go through. Moreover, user (the beneficiary) may be unable to access `_recipient` to increase the relayer fee.

## Vulnerability Detail

In `CrosschainDistributor` in the [`_settleClaim` function](https://github.com/sherlock-audit/2023-06-tokensoft/blob/main/contracts/contracts/claim/abstract/CrosschainDistributor.sol#L61-L89) the `xcall` made has zero native relayer fee, as well as lacks slippage ability. Hence, the claim is very likely to fail to execute, especially is the liquidity is required if the asset can be accessed cross-chain.

To change the slippage, the `_recipient` would need to update it. Sometimes, `_recipient`s may be unable to do so, for example in case this address is a centralized exchange personal deposit address. User has no access to it, and it is a valid `_recipient` from the point of view of the protocol.

## Impact

The token claim may be locked inside connext, which constitutes loss of funds for the distributor (as the funds didn't go to the user).

## Code Snippet

```js
      id = connext.xcall(
        _recipientDomain, // destination domain
        _recipient, // to
        address(token), // asset
        _recipient, // delegate, only required for self-execution + slippage
        _amount, // amount
        0, // slippage -- assumes no pools on connext
        bytes('') // calldata
      );
```

## Tool used

Manual Review

## Recommendation

Sponsor the gas fees needed. Set the delegate (entity that can update slippage) to `address(this)` and create a permissioned function so that both owner and beneficiary could update slippage for the claim.
