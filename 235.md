# Merkle Root Changes Lead to Failed Claims and Loss of Relayer Fees

## Summary
Changes to the merkle root can lead to failed claims, especially in cases where users have submitted low relayer fees. This could result in users losing their relayer fees.

## Vulnerability Detail
Changes in the merkle root can result in the failure of claims requested through `xcall`. For instance, if a user submits a low relayer fee, the `xcall` request might be put into a pending state. If the owner changes the root during this time, the subsequently arriving `xReceive` calls would fail because their proofs are no longer valid. Consequently, users could end up losing the relayer fees they have submitted.

## Impact
Users losing their relayer fees due to failed claims

Manual Review

## Recommendation
it's recommended that once an airdrop starts, changes to the root should be disallowed. Alternatively, a different design approach that prevents such scenarios should be considered.
