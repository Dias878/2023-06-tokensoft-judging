# Vote Factor Alteration During Airdrop Leads to Unfair Voting Power Allocation

## Summary
In the `setVoteFactor` function, which sets the amount of voting power per unclaimed token. If this value is changed in the middle of an airdrop, it can lead to an unfair situation, as some users may gain disproportionate voting power.



## Vulnerability Detail
The `setVoteFactor` function determines the voting power provided per unclaimed token. A change in this value during an airdrop can result in unfair distribution of voting power. Consider the following scenario:

1. The voteFactor is initially set to 1.
2. UserA is allocated 1000 units, which grants them 1000 voting power.
3. UserB, who has also been allocated 1000 units but has not called `initializeDistributionRecord`, remains.
4. The admin changes the voteFactor to 2.
5. UserB then calls `initializeDistributionRecord` and receives a voting power of 2000.
As seen in this scenario, changing the voteFactor during an airdrop can lead to an unfair distribution of voting power.
## Impact
This vulnerability can lead to unfair voting power distribution.

## Tool used

Manual Review

## Recommendation
Once an airdrop starts, changing the setVoteFactor value should be disallowed.
