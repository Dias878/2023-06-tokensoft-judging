# Incorrect Price Tier Calculation Due to block.timestamp Usage

## Summary
 The `PriceTierVestingSale_2_0` contract is vulnerable to incorrect price tier calculations because it relies on `block.timestamp` for time-sensitive operations, potentially leading to discrepancies in vested token amounts.
## Vulnerability Detail
The vulnerability lies in the `getClaimableAmount` function of the `PriceTierVestingSale_2_0` contract. This function calculates the claimable token amount for a beneficiary based on the current block timestamp (`block.timestamp`). However, using `block.timestamp` for time-sensitive calculations can result in inaccuracies, especially when the timestamp changes to the next price tier.
## Impact
The incorrect usage of `block.timestamp` can lead to beneficiaries receiving an incorrect vested token amount. In particular, if a beneficiary attempts to claim tokens at the exact moment when the timestamp changes to the next price tier, the calculation may be based on the previous price tier, resulting in a higher or lower claimable amount than intended.

Manual Review

## Recommendation
Given the nature of the contract, we think the risk of miner manipulation of `block.timestamp` is really low. We recommend the team to consider the potential risk and switch to `block.number` if necessary.
