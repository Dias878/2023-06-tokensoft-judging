# Nonces not used in signed data

## Summary
 Nonces not used in signed data
 
## Vulnerability Detail

 Nonces not used in signed data in contract CrosschainMerkleDistributor.sol:: claimBySignature

A nonce can prevent an old value from being used when a new value exists. Without one, two transactions submitted in one order, can appear in a block in a different order

## Impact
 a malicious miner can change the order of the transactions, which can be dangerous
## Code Snippet
```solidity
 bytes32 _signed = keccak256(
      abi.encodePacked(_recipient, _recipientDomain, _beneficiary, _beneficiaryDomain, _total)
    );
```
