# Missing checks on the onlyConnext modifier

## Summary
Missing checks on the onlyConnext modifier

## Vulnerability Detail

According to Connext's documentation, when using permissioned functions with xcall, you have to check from which domain it comes:

https://docs.connext.network/developers/guides/authentication

Currently:

```solidity
  modifier onlyConnext() {
    require(msg.sender == address(connext), '!connext');
    _;
  }
  ```
  it is only checking that msg.sender  is the connext contract, but it is not checked the expected domain:

## Impact
Any call from other domains will also go through even if not intended by tokensoft

## Tool used

Manual Review

## Recommendation

```diff
  modifier onlyConnext(uint32 _origin) {
    require(msg.sender == address(connext), '!connext');
+  _origin == <ORIGIN_DOMAIN>
    _;
  }
```
