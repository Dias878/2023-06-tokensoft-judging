# Should not mint new amount when distribute record to the same beneficiary gets replaced if it was not claimed before

## Summary
Should not mint new amount when distribute record to the same beneficiary gets replaced if it was not claimed before

## Vulnerability Detail
AdvancedDistributor#_initializeDistributionRecord 

```solidity
  function _initializeDistributionRecord(
    address beneficiary,
    uint256 totalAmount
  ) internal virtual override {
    super._initializeDistributionRecord(beneficiary, totalAmount);

    // add voting power through ERC20Votes extension
    _mint(beneficiary, tokensToVotes(totalAmount));
  }
```  

can be called multiple times and totalAmount is updated to a new value in Distributor#_initializeDistributionRecord

```solidity
  function _initializeDistributionRecord(
    address beneficiary,
    uint256 _totalAmount
  ) internal virtual {
    uint120 totalAmount = uint120(_totalAmount);

    // Checks
    require(totalAmount <= type(uint120).max, 'Distributor: totalAmount > type(uint120).max');

    // Effects - note that the existing claimed quantity is re-used during re-initialization
    records[beneficiary] = DistributionRecord(true, totalAmount, records[beneficiary].claimed);
    // @audit new totalAmount always gets replaced
    emit InitializeDistributionRecord(beneficiary, totalAmount);
  }
```

However, when AdvancedDistributor#_initializeDistributionRecord is called again, system will mint NEW totalAmount (which is wrong for distributionRecord that is not claimed before).

## Impact
Wrong additional token will be minted if distributionRecord gets replaced.

## Tool used
Manual Review

## Recommendation
If a distributionRecord is not claimable and the record gets replaced, 

Let' say A = old amount and B = new amount

If B < A, system should burn A-B amount
If A < B, system should mint B-A amount
