# Third-party Claims in Distributor Contract

## Summary
The ```claim()``` function in Distributor allows any address to initiate a claim and burn for an arbitrary beneficiary address. This allows attackers to burn funds from user accounts without authorization.

## Vulnerability Detail

- The ```claim()``` function is defined as:
```solidity



function claim(address beneficiary) external {

  uint256 amount = _executeClaim(beneficiary);
  
  _settleClaim(beneficiary, amount);

}
```
- The ```beneficiary``` parameter can be any address, not just the address that called the function.

- An attacker can call ```claim(victimAddress)``` to initiate a claim burn for any victim.

- The flow would be:
   - Attacker calls ```claim(victim)```
   - ```_executeClaim()``` burns tokens from the victim's vesting balance
   - ```_settleClaim()``` transfers burned tokens to the victim
   - Attacker has initiated an unauthorized burn of victim's tokens


## Impact

This vulnerability allows attackers to:
- Burn victim account tokens, leading to loss of funds
- Drain victim gas by initiating repeated claims
- Disrupt service by burning claimant tokens before they can claim

### claim()
```solidity
        function claim(address beneficiary) external nonReentrant {
                // effects
                uint256 claimedAmount = super._executeClaim(beneficiary, records[beneficiary].total);
                // interactions
                super._settleClaim(beneficiary, claimedAmount);
        }
```

### _executeClaim()
```solidity
  function _executeClaim(
    address beneficiary,
    uint256 _totalAmount
  ) internal virtual returns (uint256) {
    uint120 totalAmount = uint120(_totalAmount);


    // effects
    if (records[beneficiary].total != totalAmount) {
      // re-initialize if the total has been updated
      _initializeDistributionRecord(beneficiary, totalAmount);
    }
    
    uint120 claimableAmount = uint120(getClaimableAmount(beneficiary));
    require(claimableAmount > 0, 'Distributor: no more tokens claimable right now');


    records[beneficiary].claimed += claimableAmount;
    claimed += claimableAmount;


    return claimableAmount;
  }
```

### _settleClaim()
```solidity
  function _settleClaim(address _recipient, uint256 _amount) internal virtual {
    token.safeTransfer(_recipient, _amount);
    emit Claim(_recipient, _amount);
  }
```

## Tool used

Manual Review

## Recommendation

Require ```beneficiary``` to be ```msg.sender``` in ```claim()```
