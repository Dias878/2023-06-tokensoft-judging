# `PriceTierVesting.getVestedFraction` returns 0 when the oracle price is equal to the price of first tier

## Summary
`PriceTierVesting.getVestedFraction` function incorrectly returns 0 as the vested fraction when the reported oracle price is less than or equal to the price of first `PriceTier`. 

## Vulnerability Detail
As per the current implementation of `getVestedFraction` function
```solidity
		uint256 price = _getOraclePrice();

		for (uint256 i = tiers.length; i != 0; ) {
			unchecked {
				--i;
			}
			if (price > tiers[i].price) {
				return tiers[i].vestedFraction;
			}
		}
		return 0;
```
For a `PriceTier` array, when the oracle price is less than or equal to the price of a tier `n`, the function returns the fraction of tier `n - 1` or 0 if the loop is exhausted. This mechanism behaves incorrectly for the first element of `PriceTier` array.

Consider this scenario
- Price tiers are set as `[{100, 2500}, {110, 5000}, {120, 10000}]`.
- When the oracle price is reported as `100`, even though the config has `2500` as its respective fraction, the function returns `0`.

Essentially the user cannot claim any tokens if the oracle price becomes 100 (or goes below that).

This implementation of `getVestedFraction` seems to be copy-pasted from `TrancheVesting` contract. The implementation fits correctly with the time based vesting logic of `TrancheVesting` but breaks the price based vesting of `PriceTierVesting`.

## Impact
When the oracle price becomes equal to the price of first tier or goes below that (which is a very likely scenario), the vested fraction of a user is considered as 0.

Most notable when the oracle price is equal to price of first tier, even though the config has a fraction value for that price, the function returns `0` preventing users from claiming any tokens.

Manual Review

## Recommendation
Consider changing the `>` operator to `>=` to make the `tiers[i].price` inclusive in the tier range.
```solidity
			if (price >= tiers[i].price) {
				return tiers[i].vestedFraction;
			}
```
