# Using blockhash for randomness is predictable and two or more transactions could have same number

## Summary
blokchash range is limited to 256 recent blocks.

## Vulnerability Detail
blockhash only returns the hash of a specific block within a limited range of previous blocks. In Ethereum, the range is limited to the 256 most recent blocks.

## Impact
There's likelihood of two different transaction having same blockhash because of the limited range of using blokchash.
