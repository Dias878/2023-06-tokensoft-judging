# Cross-chain replay attacks are possible with `claimBySignature`

## Summary
Cross-chain replay attacks are possible with `claimBySignature`
## Vulnerability Detail
in the `CrossChainMerkleDistributor.sol` the `claimBySignature`  function doesn't use chain.id in the signed data

## Impact
if user does the action in wrong chain an attacker can replay the action on the correct chain, and steal the funds a-la the Wintermute gnosis safe attack, where the attacker can create the same address that the user tried to, and steal the funds from there
## Code Snippet
```solidity 

 function claimBySignature(
    address _recipient,
    uint32 _recipientDomain,
    address _beneficiary,
    uint32 _beneficiaryDomain,
    uint256 _total,
    bytes calldata _signature,
    bytes32[] calldata _proof
  ) external {
    // Recover the signature by beneficiary
    bytes32 _signed = keccak256(
      abi.encodePacked(_recipient, _recipientDomain, _beneficiary, _beneficiaryDomain, _total)
    );
    address recovered = _recoverSignature(_signed, _signature);
    require(recovered == _beneficiary, '!recovered');

    // Validate the claim
    _verifyMembership(_getLeaf(_beneficiary, _total, _beneficiaryDomain), _proof);
    uint256 claimedAmount = _executeClaim(_beneficiary, _total);

    _settleClaim(_beneficiary, _recipient, _recipientDomain, claimedAmount);
  }
```

## Tool used

Manual Review

## Recommendation

Include the chain.id in what's hashed

```solidity
     abi.encodePacked(_recipient, _recipientDomain, _beneficiary, _beneficiaryDomain, _total, block.chainid)
    
```
