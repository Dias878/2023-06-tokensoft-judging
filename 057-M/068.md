# Anyone can lower the voting power for another user



## Summary
It is possible before a proposal, a given party to lower the voting power of the other party to ease off the voting procedure and in a way manipulate it.

## Vulnerability Detail
1. [CrosschainTrancheVestingMerkle.sol](https://github.com/sherlock-audit/2023-06-tokensoft/blob/main/contracts/contracts/claim/CrosschainTrancheVestingMerkle.sol) which is one of the [primary contracts](https://github.com/sherlock-audit/2023-06-tokensoft/tree/main/contracts#about-the-cross-chain-distributor) implements from `CrosschainMerkleDistributor`
 2. In [CrosschainMerkleDistributor](https://github.com/sherlock-audit/2023-06-tokensoft/blob/main/contracts/contracts/claim/abstract/CrosschainMerkleDistributor.sol) anyone can call [claimByMerkleProof](https://github.com/sherlock-audit/2023-06-tokensoft/blob/main/contracts/contracts/claim/abstract/CrosschainMerkleDistributor.sol#L93-L104) (if the merkle tree is set) which claims the reward tokens and sends them to the `_beneficiary`.
```jsx
  function claimByMerkleProof(
    address _beneficiary,
    uint256 _total,
    bytes32[] calldata _proof
  ) external {
    _verifyMembership(_getLeaf(_beneficiary, _total, domain), _proof);
    uint256 claimedAmount = _executeClaim(_beneficiary, _total);
    _settleClaim(_beneficiary, _beneficiary, domain, claimedAmount);
  }
```
3. When rewards are claimed with `claimByMerkleProof`, [_executeClaim](https://github.com/sherlock-audit/2023-06-tokensoft/blob/main/contracts/contracts/claim/abstract/AdvancedDistributor.sol#L87-L95) is called which lowers/burns the voting power of the beneficiary.

```jsx
  function _executeClaim(
    address beneficiary,
    uint256 totalAmount
  ) internal virtual override returns (uint256 _claimed) {
    _claimed = super._executeClaim(beneficiary, totalAmount);
    _burn(beneficiary, tokensToVotes(_claimed));//@audit voteTokens are burned, and voting power is lowered
  }
```
**Example:**
- DAO vote is coming and small part of the users (20%) wanna propose and pass a certain vote (either malicious or a risky investment)

1. To make it easier, they spend some gas and call  `claimByMerkleProof` on the other users with big voting power
2. Now when it's time to vote, most users won't have the voting power to deny/fail this vote
3. The vote passes due to the small group having the majority of the vote tokens

## Impact
DAO votes can be manipulated

Manual Review

## Recommendation
Make it so users either need to allow someone to claim their rewards or to claim them for themselves.
