# Open claiming can lead to voting power manipulation

## Summary
Anyone can initiate a claim for another user by providing a valid merkle proof. Claiming tokens burns voting power. Therefore, anyone can strategically reduce the voting power of other users with pending claims.

## Vulnerability Detail
The `CrosschainMerkleDistributor.claimByMerkleProof()` function allows a user to claim for another user by providing a valid merkle proof:

```solidity
  function claimByMerkleProof(
    address _beneficiary,
    uint256 _total,
    bytes32[] calldata _proof
  ) external {
    _verifyMembership(_getLeaf(_beneficiary, _total, domain), _proof);
    // effects
    uint256 claimedAmount = _executeClaim(_beneficiary, _total);


    // interactions
    _settleClaim(_beneficiary, _beneficiary, domain, claimedAmount);
  }
```

This calls the `_executeClaim()` function which burns voting power tokens:

**AdvancedDistributor._executeClaim()**:
```solidity
  function _executeClaim(
    address beneficiary,
    uint256 totalAmount
  ) internal virtual override returns (uint256 _claimed) {
    _claimed = super._executeClaim(beneficiary, totalAmount);


    // reduce voting power through ERC20Votes extension
    _burn(beneficiary, tokensToVotes(_claimed));
  }
```

**Note:** Besides the above unguarded open claiming function, the same effect can be achieved by replaying `claimBySignature()` calls.

## Impact
- Ability to manipulate voting power by initiating claims for others.

## Tool used
Manual Review

## Recommendation
Do not allow users to claim for other users via `claimByMerkleProof()`. For the `claimBySignature()` function, add a nonce requirement to ensure that the call can only be made once for a signature.
