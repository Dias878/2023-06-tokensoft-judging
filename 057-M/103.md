# Anyone can initiate claiming for arbitrary beneficiary

## Summary
The AdvancedDistributor._executeClaim function allows any user to execute the claim on behalf of any beneficiary, even if they are not the rightful beneficiary, unintentionally lowering their voting power.
## Vulnerability Detail
The internal, _executeClaim function in AdvanceDistributor contract is responsible for recording the claim and burning the ERC20Votes tokens. The _initializeDistributionRecord function mint those tokens for users provided by the admins. However, any user can initiate the claim on behalf of any beneficiary, even if they are not the rightful beneficiary, which will result in a reduction of voting power for that beneficiary.

## Impact
Unauthorized users can manipulate voting power by initiating undesired claims for arbitrary beneficiaries

[BasicDistributor.sol#L46-L51](https://github.com/sherlock-audit/2023-06-tokensoft/blob/main/contracts/contracts/claim/BasicDistributor.sol#L46-L51)
```solidity
function claim(address beneficiary) external nonReentrant {
  // effects
  uint256 claimedAmount = super._executeClaim(beneficiary, records[beneficiary].total);
  // interactions
  super._settleClaim(beneficiary, claimedAmount);
   }
```
[AdvancedDistributor.sol#L87-L95](https://github.com/sherlock-audit/2023-06-tokensoft/blob/main/contracts/contracts/claim/abstract/AdvancedDistributor.sol#L87-L95)
```solidity
  function _executeClaim(
    address beneficiary,
    uint256 totalAmount
  ) internal virtual override returns (uint256 _claimed) {
    _claimed = super._executeClaim(beneficiary, totalAmount);

    // reduce voting power through ERC20Votes extension
    _burn(beneficiary, tokensToVotes(_claimed));
  }
```
