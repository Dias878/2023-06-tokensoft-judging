# Claiming tokens for other users decreases their voting power

## Summary
Claiming tokens for other users decreases their voting power and, when done maliciously, can benefit an attacker.
This is relevant to all distributor contracts, but for the sake of simplicity, only the CrosschainMerkleDistributor contract will be examined.
## Vulnerability Detail
The claimByMerkleProof function of CrosschainMerkleDistributor enables any user to claim the tokens for a beneficiary using a merkle proof. When calling claimByMerkleProof, _executeClaim will be evoked, which burns the voting tokens of the beneficiary reducing their voting power.
## Impact
The major issue is that an attacker is capable of burning voting tokens of a vast number of users, lowering their voting power. This consequently would result in the malicious user having more voting influence than expected and manipulating the results of any Governance vote.
