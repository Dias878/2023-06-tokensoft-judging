# Voting power can be removed on behalf of any user

## Summary
The `_burn()` function can be triggered to burn the voting token of anyone

## Vulnerability Detail
In all the distributors, the `claim()` function can be executed on behalf of any user. These functions call the inherited `_executeClaim()` method which removes the voting power of such user.

## Impact
The voting power given in the aidrop initial distribution of a user can be removed at anytime by a malicious actor. Hence, the user is no longer able to participate in the DAO.

All these distributor contracts are impacted:
- BasicDistributor.sol
- ContinuousVestingMerkle.sol
- PriceTierVestingMerkle.sol
- PriceTierVestingSale_2_0.sol
- TrancheVestingMerkle.sol
- TrancheVestingSale_1_3.sol
- TrancheVestingSale_2_0.sol

## Code Snippet
```solidity
File: contracts/claim/abstract/AdvancedDistributor.sol

L87: function _executeClaim(
    address beneficiary,
    uint256 totalAmount
  ) internal virtual override returns (uint256 _claimed) {
    _claimed = super._executeClaim(beneficiary, totalAmount);

    // reduce voting power through ERC20Votes extension
    // @audit - This line that burns the voting tokens can be called with any beneficiary
    _burn(beneficiary, tokensToVotes(_claimed));
  }
```

## Tool used

Manual Review

## Recommendation
Check that only the beneficiary can claim his reward.
For example in BasicDistributor.sol:

```diff
File: contracts/claim/BasicDistributor.sol

function claim(address beneficiary) external nonReentrant {
+ require(beneficiary == msg.sender, "Not allowed to claim funds");
  // effects
  uint256 claimedAmount = super._executeClaim(beneficiary, records[beneficiary].total); 
  // interactions
  super._settleClaim(beneficiary, claimedAmount);
}
```
