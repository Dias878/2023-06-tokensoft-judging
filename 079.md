# `_setTotal` will not work

## Summary
The `_setTotal` function in [CrosschainDistributor](https://github.com/sherlock-audit/2023-06-tokensoft/blob/main/contracts/contracts/claim/abstract/CrosschainDistributor.sol), [CrosschainContinuousVestingMerkle](https://github.com/sherlock-audit/2023-06-tokensoft/blob/main/contracts/contracts/claim/CrosschainContinuousVestingMerkle.sol) and [CrosschainTrancheVestingMerkle](https://github.com/sherlock-audit/2023-06-tokensoft/blob/main/contracts/contracts/claim/CrosschainTrancheVestingMerkle.sol) will not work.
## Vulnerability Detail
`_setTotal` will simply not work, because is calls [_allowConnext](https://github.com/sherlock-audit/2023-06-tokensoft/blob/main/contracts/contracts/claim/abstract/CrosschainDistributor.sol#L35-L37) which in tern calls ` token.safeApprove`.
```jsx
  function _allowConnext(uint256 amount) internal {
    token.safeApprove(address(connext), amount);
  }
```
Firstly `safeApprove` is deprecated and secondly if there is any left approved amount it will revert.
```jsx
    function safeApprove(
        IERC20 token,
        address spender,
        uint256 value
    ) internal {
        require(
            (value == 0) || (token.allowance(address(this), spender) == 0),
            "SafeERC20: approve from non-zero to non-zero allowance"
        );
        _callOptionalReturn(token, abi.encodeWithSelector(token.approve.selector, spender, value));
```

**Example scenario:**

1. Users are given a total rewards and some claimed and others not. With every claim total approved amount is lowered.
2. `setTotal` is called, but it inevitable reverts since some users have not claimed their rewards and may never claim them.
Thus setting of new Total is impossible.

## Recommendation
It's recommended to use approve (safeApprove is not safe) or use decrease/increase allowance.
