# encodePacked data used for decoding instead of encode can lead to error on xReceive call of Connext.

## Summary
[abi.encodePacked](https://docs.soliditylang.org/en/v0.8.12/abi-spec.html?highlight=encode#non-standard-packed-mode) is a non-standard encoding that should preferably not be used due to its ambiguity with dynamic types

## Vulnerability Detail
This encoding scheme is used in the Satellite contract which is responsible for cross-chain token claiming for beneficiaries. The procedure is simple, the function initiateClaim is called by a beneficiary which triggers the Connext xcall method, the relayer fees are paid, and finally, the xReceive would be called by the Connext to settle the claims.

## Code Snippet
Satellite.sol - line 95
```solidity
   // Send the claim to the distributor via cross-chain call
    bytes32 transferId = connext.xcall{ value: msg.value }(
      _distributorDomain, // destination domain
      address(distributor), // to
      address(0), // asset
      address(0), // delegate, only required for self-execution + slippage
      0, // total
      0, // slippage
      abi.encodePacked(msg.sender, _domain, total, proof) // data
    );
```

CrosschainMerkleDistributor.sol - line 72,73
```solidity
   // The xReceive which is on the recipient chain side, decodes this data:
    (address beneficiary, uint32 beneficiaryDomain, uint256 totalAmount, bytes32[] memory proof) 
    = abi.decode(_callData, (address, uint32, uint256, bytes32[]));
```

Manual Review

## Recommendation
Use abi.encode instead of abi.encodePacked.
