# An attacker can create a valid merkle proof for a beneficiary and claim the funds for a different domain and recipient address

## Summary
The contract does not have a mechanism to verify that the domain specified in claimByMerkleProof and claimBySignature matches the domain set in the merkle leaf.
## Vulnerability Detail
1. claimBySignature: This method allows a beneficiary to specify any Connext domain and recipient address to receive the tokens. The contract only verifies the signature of the beneficiary on the leaf and the merkle proof. However, it does not check whether the specified recipient domain matches the domain set in the merkle leaf. This means that an attacker can claim the funds and provide a different recipient domain, directing the funds to an address not intended to receive them.

2. claimByMerkleProof: Similarly, this method allows anyone to claim funds for a beneficiary using a merkle proof. Again, the contract only verifies the merkle proof but does not validate whether the specified recipient domain matches the domain set in the merkle leaf. An attacker can provide a valid merkle proof and claim the funds for a different domain and recipient address.
## Impact
An attacker can claim funds on behalf of a beneficiary but redirect the funds to a different domain and recipient address of their choice. This allows the attacker to potentially steal funds intended for a legitimate beneficiary.

## Tool used

Manual Review

## Recommendation
Add a validation step in both the claimBySignature and claimByMerkleProof methods to ensure that the domain specified by the beneficiary matches the domain set in the merkle leaf.
