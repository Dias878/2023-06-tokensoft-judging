# Chainlink does not actually support xDai

## Summary
Chainlink does not actually support xDai

## Vulnerability Detail
Currently, Chainlink does not have price feeds in xDai, therefore the oracles will not work there. As stated in the docs tokensoft will deploy there.

You can check out: https://data.chain.link/  and see that it is not supported in chains

## Impact
Tokensoft will not work in xDai as of current deployment plan

## Code Snippet

## Tool used

Manual Review

## Recommendation
Do use a secondary oracle that supports xDAI i case Chainlink is not supported
