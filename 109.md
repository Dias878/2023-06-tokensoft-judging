# Unlimited votes due to lack of balance check in _initializeDistributionRecord

## Summary
Every time the _initializeDistributionRecord function of AdvancedDistributor.sol is called, tokensToVotes(totalAmount) number of votes are minted, regardless of previously minted votes.

## Vulnerability Detail
When _initializeDistributionRecord is called, the total number of votes based on the current initialized record total are [cumulatively minted](https://github.com/sherlock-audit/2023-06-tokensoft/blob/main/contracts/contracts/claim/abstract/AdvancedDistributor.sol#L84). However, this does not account for previously minted votes.

## Impact
Users can simply repeatedly call _initializeDistributionRecord through an inherited function, such as the [initializeDistributionRecord function](https://github.com/sherlock-audit/2023-06-tokensoft/blob/main/contracts/contracts/claim/ContinuousVestingMerkle.sol#L43-L53) of ContinuousVestingMerkle contract to inflate their votes, while maintaining a constant claim total, thereby breaking the vote mechanism entirely.

An actor with any amount of vested tokens can easily gain unlimited votes and pass any malicious proposals, resulting in potentially catastrophic loss of funds for protocols that use the 'voting-while-vesting' mechanism.

This affects:
1. ContinuousVestingMerkle
2. PriceTierVestingMerkle
3. PriceTierVestingSale_2_0
4. TrancheVestingMerkle (not in scope)
5. TrancheVestingSale_1_3 (not in scope)
6. TrancheVestingSale_2_0 (not in scope)

## Code Snippet
Advanced distributor: ``
function _initializeDistributionRecord(
    address beneficiary,
    uint256 totalAmount
  ) internal virtual override {
    super._initializeDistributionRecord(beneficiary, totalAmount);

    // add voting power through ERC20Votes extension
    _mint(beneficiary, tokensToVotes(totalAmount));
  }
Distributor:``
function _initializeDistributionRecord(
    address beneficiary,
    uint256 _totalAmount
  ) internal virtual {
    uint120 totalAmount = uint120(_totalAmount);

    // Checks
    require(totalAmount <= type(uint120).max, 'Distributor: totalAmount > type(uint120).max');

    // Effects - note that the existing claimed quantity is re-used during re-initialization
    records[beneficiary] = DistributionRecord(true, totalAmount, records[beneficiary].claimed);
    emit InitializeDistributionRecord(beneficiary, totalAmount);
  }
``

## Tool used
Manual Review

## Recommendation
Add a require statement to the initializeDistributionRecord function of ContinuousVestingMerkle that checks whether the distribution record has already been initialized. Add similar require statements to the initializeDistributionRecord functions in the contracts mentioned above.

Alternatively, create an auxiliary method that does dynamic minting/burning of votes for use in both _initializeDistributionRecord and _executeClaim of the AdvancedDistributor contract that checks the current balance of votes compared to the new claimable total. This is not recommended due to the added complexity weighing down the already expensive distribution of all inherited contracts.
