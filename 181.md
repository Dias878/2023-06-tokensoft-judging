# Risk of unexpected reverts due to lack of slippage acceptance

## Summary
When the slippage on xcall is set to 0, it indicates that the user does not accept any slippage. This can lead to unexpected behavior and potential reverts during transaction execution.
## Vulnerability Detail
The _settleClaim in CrosschainDistributor contract calls the xcall function, which allows cross-domain execution of a transaction. However, the slippage parameter is set to 0, indicating no acceptance of slippage by the user.
## Impact
Transactions may unexpectedly fail due to price fluctuations during the cross-domain execution.
## Code Snippet
[CrosschainDistributor.sol#L78-L87](https://github.com/sherlock-audit/2023-06-tokensoft/blob/main/contracts/contracts/claim/abstract/CrosschainDistributor.sol#L78-L87)
```solidity
      id = connext.xcall(
        _recipientDomain, // destination domain
        _recipient, // to
        address(token), // asset
        _recipient, // delegate, only required for self-execution + slippage
        _amount, // amount
        0, // slippage -- assumes no pools on connext
        bytes('') // calldata
      );
    }

```

## Recommendation
Consider setting a reasonable amount of slippage, so as to avoid reverts.
