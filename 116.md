# Risk of losing the `totalAmount` due to incorrect checks


## Summary

In the `Distributor` contract, there is a check to verify if the `totalAmount` reaches the maximum value of `uint120`.
However, this check is performed after converting `uint256` to `uint120`, it's making the condition always true.


## Vulnerability Detail

https://github.com/sherlock-audit/2023-06-tokensoft/blob/main/contracts/contracts/claim/abstract/Distributor.sol#L54

```solidity
File: contracts/contracts/claim/abstract/Distributor.sol#L47-L59
    function _initializeDistributionRecord(
        address beneficiary,
        uint256 _totalAmount
    ) internal virtual {
        uint120 totalAmount = uint120(_totalAmount);

        // Checks
        require(totalAmount <= type(uint120).max, 'Distributor: totalAmount > type(uint120).max'); // @audit should be _totalAmount

        // Effects - note that the existing claimed quantity is re-used during re-initialization
        records[beneficiary] = DistributionRecord(true, totalAmount, records[beneficiary].claimed);
        emit InitializeDistributionRecord(beneficiary, totalAmount);
    }

File: contracts/contracts/claim/abstract/AdvancedDistributorDistributor.sol#L110
    function adjust(address beneficiary, int256 amount) external onlyOwner {
        DistributionRecord memory distributionRecord = records[beneficiary];
        require(distributionRecord.initialized, 'must initialize before adjusting');

        uint256 diff = uint256(amount > 0 ? amount : -amount);
        require(diff < type(uint120).max, 'adjustment > max uint120'); // @audit should be <=

```

## Impact

The totalAmount is at risk of being lost if it exceeds the maximum value of uint120.
