# Gas Exhaustion in BasicDistributor Constructor

## Summary
The `BasicDistributor` contract's constructor contains a vulnerability that can lead to gas exhaustion and potential Denial-of-Service (DoS) attacks. The issue arises due to the use of a gas-intensive loop to initialize distribution records for each recipient during contract deployment.
## Vulnerability Detail
In the `BasicDistributor` constructor, the contract aims to distribute tokens to multiple recipients based on pre-defined amounts. However, the constructor uses a for loop to iterate over the `_recipients` array and initialize distribution records for each recipient. While initializing the distribution records is a legitimate task, it can become problematic when there is a large number of recipients. This is because each iteration of the loop consumes gas, and the gas cost can escalate significantly when the number of recipients exceeds a certain limit.
The gas consumption becomes a security concern as distributing tokens to a large number of recipients can exceed the block gas limit, leading to an out-of-gas error. As a result, the contract's deployment would be reverted, denying legitimate users from claiming their tokens and potentially causing a DoS attack.
```solidity
constructor(
    IERC20 _token,
    uint256 _total,
    string memory _uri,
    uint256 _voteFactor,
    address[] memory _recipients,
    uint256[] memory _amounts
) AdvancedDistributor(_token, _total, _uri, _voteFactor, 10000, 0, uint160(uint256(blockhash(block.number - 1)))) {
    require(_recipients.length == _amounts.length, "_recipients, _amounts different lengths");
    uint256 _t;
  @>  for (uint256 i = _recipients.length; i != 0; ) {
        unchecked {
            --i;
        }

        _initializeDistributionRecord(_recipients[i], _amounts[i]);
        _t += _amounts[i];
    }
    require(_total == _t, "sum(_amounts) != _total");
}

```
## Impact
The impact of this vulnerability is that the contract deployment or token distribution process can be interrupted by an out-of-gas error. If an attacker intentionally sends a transaction to the constructor with a large number of recipients, they can exhaust the gas and cause the deployment to fail, thereby preventing legitimate users from receiving their tokens. This gas exhaustion issue could lead to a DoS attack.

    IERC20 _token,
    uint256 _total,
    string memory _uri,
    uint256 _voteFactor,
    address[] memory _recipients,
    uint256[] memory _amounts
) AdvancedDistributor(_token, _total, _uri, _voteFactor, 10000, 0, uint160(uint256(blockhash(block.number - 1)))) {
    require(_recipients.length == _amounts.length, "_recipients, _amounts different lengths");
    uint256 _t = _total;
    
    for (uint256 i = 0; i < _recipients.length; i++) {
        _token.transfer(_recipients[i], _amounts[i]);
        _t -= _amounts[i];
    }
    require(_t == 0, "sum(_amounts) != _total");
}
