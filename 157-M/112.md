# wrong approve which leads to some function to not work properly

## Summary
approving to non initialized token 

## Vulnerability Detail
The contract **CrosschainContinuousVestingMerkle** calls another contract constructs the **CrosschainMerkleDistributor** and **CrosschainMerkleDistributor** and the token is initialized  in the CrosschainMerkleDistributor but  **CrosschainMerkleDistributor** constructor will call another contract called **CrosschainDistributor** and this contract  will try to approve the **connext**   by calling _allowConnext
`constructor(IConnext _connext, uint256 _total) {
    connext = _connext;
    domain = uint32(_connext.domain());
    _allowConnext(_total);
  }`
but since the token is initialized  in the second call token= address(0) and _allowConnext will try to call address(0) with the approve function and connext will not be approved with the right token since the token is initialized  in the second call of the constructor in **CrosschainContinuousVestingMerkle**

## Impact
_settleClaim  will not work properly if we wanted to receive the token on different domain because **connext** will not be able to transfer the tokens from **CrosschainContinuousVestingMerkle** since connex doesn't have enough approve

Manual Review

## Recommendation
first initialize the token before approving
