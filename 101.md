# CrosschainMerkleDistributor.sol - possible replay of merkle proof to reinitialize record

## Summary
The ``CrosschainMerkleDistributor.sol`` introduces the external, no access control, function ``initializeDistributionRecord()`` which takes in the needed parameters to construct the leaf. This function is susceptible to a replay.

## Vulnerability Detail
The protocol has done a good job at preventing crosschain replay by encoding the chain/domain in the ``_getLead`` function andalso users from claiming more than their initial total, but making the ``claimed`` property unreinitializable, hence removing the merit of a user replaying his proof. But there is a problem regarding the internal vote tracker tokens (IVT). The ``_initializeDistributionRecord`` of the ``AdvancedDistributor`` calls the super function from the ``Distributor`` which is the one setting the funds protection, but regardless of if there is a reinitialization or not, there will always be IVT tokens minted to the beneficiary, thus a malicious actor can just replay their initialization to mint themselves as much IVT as they want.

## Impact
Uncontrolled self minting of vote tokens, disrupting internal accounting and other parts of the protocol

## Tool used

Manual Review

## Recommendation
There would be a couple of ways to mitigate this - change the merkle proofs to include a deadline or some kind of nonce to invoke expiration of the initialization proof, do not allow the reinitialization of a record or check if it has been initialized before and do not mint more IVT in that case.
