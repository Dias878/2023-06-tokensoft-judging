# Unauthorized Claims in the `_executeClaim` Function

## Summary
The `_executeClaim` function in the `Distributor` contract allows beneficiaries to claim their allocated tokens. However, it lacks proper permission checks, making it vulnerable to unauthorized claims. Malicious or unauthorized callers could potentially execute this function for a beneficiary, leading to unauthorized token claims.

## Vulnerability Detail
The `_executeClaim` function in the `Distributor` contract is designed to internally record a claim made by a beneficiary. However, it assumes that the caller has already verified the validity of the claim and does not perform any explicit checks on permissions or the caller's authority to make the claim on behalf of a specific beneficiary. This lack of permission checks opens up the possibility for unauthorized parties to claim tokens on behalf of beneficiaries.
```solidity
function _executeClaim(address beneficiary, uint256 _totalAmount) internal virtual returns (uint256) {
    uint120 totalAmount = uint120(_totalAmount);

    // effects
    if (records[beneficiary].total != totalAmount) {
        // re-initialize if the total has been updated
        _initializeDistributionRecord(beneficiary, totalAmount);
    }
    
    uint120 claimableAmount = uint120(getClaimableAmount(beneficiary));
    require(claimableAmount > 0, 'Distributor: no more tokens claimable right now');

    records[beneficiary].claimed += claimableAmount;
    claimed += claimableAmount;

    return claimableAmount;
}
```
## Impact
Unauthorized claims can lead to a misallocation of tokens, potentially resulting in financial losses for legitimate beneficiaries. Malicious actors could exploit this vulnerability to claim tokens on behalf of others, causing confusion and undermining the distribution process.

## Recommendation
You can use access control mechanisms like OpenZeppelin's Ownable or AccessControl to restrict access to this function to only authorized addresses.
