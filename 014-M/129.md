# Incorrect Token Vesting Due to Misused Claim Logic

## Summary
The `PriceTierVestingSale_2_0` contract contains a flaw in the claim function, where it incorrectly passes `purchasedAmount` to `super._executeClaim` instead of the appropriate `claimableAmount`. This misuse of the claim logic allows beneficiaries to claim all purchased tokens immediately, bypassing the vesting schedule and leading to an inequitable distribution of tokens.
## Vulnerability Detail
In the `PriceTierVestingSale_2_0` contract, the `claim` function allows beneficiaries to claim their vested tokens. However, the incorrect parameter is passed to `super._executeClaim`, resulting in the wrong vested token amount being claimed. The flawed code is as follows:
```solidity
function claim(address beneficiary) external validSaleParticipant(beneficiary) nonReentrant {
    uint256 claimableAmount = getClaimableAmount(beneficiary);
    
    // Incorrect: The purchasedAmount should be replaced with claimableAmount
    uint256 claimedAmount = super._executeClaim(beneficiary, purchasedAmount);
    
    // interactions
    super._settleClaim(beneficiary, claimedAmount);
}
```
## Impact
Incorrect Token Vesting: By using `purchasedAmount`, beneficiaries would be able to claim the total amount of tokens they purchased during the sale immediately, without consideration of the vesting schedule. This defeats the purpose of vesting, where tokens should be distributed gradually over time based on the vesting conditions.

Manual Review

## Recommendation
```solidity
function claim(address beneficiary) external validSaleParticipant(beneficiary) nonReentrant {
    uint256 claimableAmount = getClaimableAmount(beneficiary);
    
    // Corrected: Pass claimableAmount to _executeClaim
    uint256 claimedAmount = super._executeClaim(beneficiary, claimableAmount);
    
    // interactions
    super._settleClaim(beneficiary, claimedAmount);
}
