# PriceTierVestingSale_2_0 doesn't take into account for extra purchase of the beneficiary.

## Summary
PriceTierVestingSale_2_0 doesn't take into account for extra purchase of the beneficiary.

## Vulnerability Detail
PriceTierVestingSale_2_0.getClaimableAmount() function calculates current claimable token amount.
And this amount MUST be calculated with current purchased amount of the beneficiary.
The code is as follows:

```solidity
File: PriceTierVestingSale_2_0.sol
122:   // get the number of tokens currently claimable by a specific user
123:   function getClaimableAmount(address beneficiary) public view override returns (uint256) {
124:     if (records[beneficiary].initialized) return super.getClaimableAmount(beneficiary);
125: 
126:     // we can get the claimable amount prior to initialization
127:     return
128:       (getPurchasedAmount(beneficiary) * getVestedFraction(beneficiary, block.timestamp)) /
129:       fractionDenominator;
130:   }
```

This function will return correct claimable amount if records[beneficiary].initialized == false.
But once this records[beneficiary].initialized is set to true, then this function's return value is not changed even if beneficiary made extra purchase into _sale.

As a result, beneficiary will get less token than he purchased.

## Impact
If any beneficiary made extra purchasement into sale after he have made first claim,
this beneficiary can not claim extra token about his extra purchasement.

## Recommendation
```solidity
File: PriceTierVestingSale_2_0.sol
122:   // get the number of tokens currently claimable by a specific user
123:   function getClaimableAmount(address beneficiary) public view override returns (uint256) {
124: -    if (records[beneficiary].initialized) return super.getClaimableAmount(beneficiary);
124: +    // if (records[beneficiary].initialized) return super.getClaimableAmount(beneficiary);
125: 
126:     // we can get the claimable amount prior to initialization
127:     return
128:       (getPurchasedAmount(beneficiary) * getVestedFraction(beneficiary, block.timestamp)) /
129:       fractionDenominator;
130:   }
```

```solidity
File: PriceTierVestingSale_2_0.sol
110:   function getDistributionRecord(
111:     address beneficiary
112:   ) external view virtual override returns (DistributionRecord memory) {
113:     DistributionRecord memory record = records[beneficiary];
114: 
115:     // workaround prior to initialization
116: -    if (!record.initialized) {
116: +   // if (!record.initialized) {
117:       record.total = uint120(getPurchasedAmount(beneficiary));
118: -    }
118: +   // }
119:     return record;
120:   }
