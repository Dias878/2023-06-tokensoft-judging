# Useless amount check in `_initializeDistributionRecord`

## Summary
The amount limitation check in `_initializeDistributionRecord` is useless.

## Vulnerability Detail
Function `contracts/claim/abstract/Distributor.sol`:
```solidity
/**
   * @dev Set up the distribution record for a user. Permissions are not checked in this function.
   * Amount is limited to type(uint120).max to allow each DistributionRecord to be packed into a single storage slot.
   * 
   * @param beneficiary The address of the beneficiary
   * @param _totalAmount The total amount of tokens to be distributed to the beneficiary
   */
  function _initializeDistributionRecord(
    address beneficiary,
    uint256 _totalAmount
  ) internal virtual {
    uint120 totalAmount = uint120(_totalAmount);

    // Checks
    require(totalAmount <= type(uint120).max, 'Distributor: totalAmount > type(uint120).max');

    // Effects - note that the existing claimed quantity is re-used during re-initialization
    records[beneficiary] = DistributionRecord(true, totalAmount, records[beneficiary].claimed);
    emit InitializeDistributionRecord(beneficiary, totalAmount);
  }
```
As the comment of this function says, the amount is limited to `type(uint120).max`. However, it checked the `totalAmount` after type casting instead of the original parameter `_totalAmount`, which will cause the check always pass.

## Impact

DistributionRecord may be inconsistent with expected parameters silently.
