# Distributor.sol#_initializeDistributionRecord - potential silent overflow

## Summary
The function ``_initializeDistributionRecord()`` is used to create a new record for a distribution for a beneficiary address and an amount of tokens. There is an unsafe downcasting on point.

## Vulnerability Detail
``uint120 totalAmount = uint120(_totalAmount);``
Since ``_totalAmount`` is of type uint256, there is a potential silent overflow. In the current implementation of the protocol this would be a rare case since only the NEXT token is in interaction with the contracts, but after disputing with the sponsor, they confirmed that this could be a problem for the scalability later on.
The problem arises from the wrong require statement:
``require(totalAmount <= type(uint120).max, 'Distributor: totalAmount > type(uint120).max');``
where it should be ``_totalAmount`` being checked, not the already downcasted value ``totalAmount``.
## Impact
Users would not be able to claim their actual amounts of tokens.

## Tool used

Manual Review

## Recommendations
The contract uses uint120 to make use of storage packing for structs, so to keep this trend, just implement OZ's safe casting library and fix the require statement.
