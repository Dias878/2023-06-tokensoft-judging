# Contract deployment may fail and waste a lot of gas fees in BasicDistributor.sol

## Summary
Big number of distribution inside constructor can lead to deployment fail and waste a lot of gas fees . As mentioned  in the natspec of `BasicDistributor.sol` ,
```solidity
 // The practical limit for this distributor is gas: distributing to 250 addresses costs about 7,000,000 gas! 
```
if a distribution period has  more then 1000 beneficiary then there's a huge probability that the contract deployment will fail waste a ton of gas fees  . And there is no checks considering the situation .

## Vulnerability Detail
See summary 

## Impact
Deployment failure and huge waste of  gas .

## Tool used

Manual Review

## Recommendation
1. Limit the number of distributions .
or ,
2. Initializing inside the constructor is a bad design choice overall for such huge amount of information, deploy the contract first and then `_initializeDistributionRecord` with a specific function with proper access control .
