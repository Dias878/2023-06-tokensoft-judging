# Everyone can mint infinity amount of VoteToken/GovernanceToken for free

## Summary

User can call `ContinuousVestingMerkle.initializeDistributionRecord()` multiple times for free.

This function override `Record` mapping and mint `VoteToken` for user. There is no check or revert if record already exist or user already minted token.

Just so user can mint more VoteToken by simply calling `initializeDistributionRecord()` again.

## Vulnerability Detail

Duplicate this line.

`await distributor.initializeDistributionRecord(index, beneficiary, amount, proof)` 

Inside [continuousVestingMerkle.test.ts](https://github.com/sherlock-audit/2023-06-tokensoft/blob/main/contracts/test/distributor/continuousVestingMerkle.test.ts#L305) will cause the test to fail.

As user get more vote token than expected when calling init twice.

## Impact

Anyone can mint infinity amount of VoteToken. While user cannot convert this into actualy airdrop token. The only thing affected is governance token.

## Tool used

Manual Review

## Recommendation

Consider replacing `_initializeDistributionRecord()` with `increasingDistributionRecord()`.
Only increase token `totalAmount` for each `validMerkleProof` once. Then burn that hash away.
