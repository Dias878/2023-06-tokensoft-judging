# No check that a user has initialized their distribution so they can increase their vote by a large amount.

## Summary

No check that a user has initialized their distribution so they can increase their vote by a large amount.

## Vulnerability Detail

Calling `ContinuousVestingMerkle.initializeDistributionRecord()` calls `_initializeDistributionRecord(beneficiary, amount)` like so:

```solidity
  function _initializeDistributionRecord(
    address beneficiary,
    uint256 totalAmount
  ) internal virtual override {
    super._initializeDistributionRecord(beneficiary, totalAmount);

    // add voting power through ERC20Votes extension
    _mint(beneficiary, tokensToVotes(totalAmount));
  }
```

There is no check if the user has already called `initializeDistributionRecord` so the user increases their voting power each time:

```solidity
  function tokensToVotes(uint256 tokenAmount) private view returns (uint256) {
    return (tokenAmount * voteFactor) / fractionDenominator;
  }
```

## Impact

No check that a user has initialized their distribution so they can increase their vote by a large amount.

## Recommendation

Check if user has already initialized their distribution so they cannot vote multiple times.
