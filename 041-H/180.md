# Wrong accounting of voting power minted to the beneficiary in most of the vesting contracts.

## Summary
Wrong accounting of voting power minted to the beneficiary in most of the vesting contracts. 

## Vulnerability Detail
The function initializeDistributionRecord is open for users to initialize their distribution record to the current purchased amount. 

However this leads to the wrong accounting of the voting power, e.g take the following scenario:
1. User has 20 purchased tokens and calls the function to initialize his distribution record. As a result the function mints voting power corresponding the 20 tokens he purchased.
3. After some time the user purchases another 20 tokens, as a result the user has 40 purchased tokens now. 
4. The user calls the function to initialize his distribution record, but instead of only minting voting power for the additional 20 tokens he bought. It mints voting power corresponding the 40 tokens.
5. In the end duo to this problem, the user has voting power for 60 tokens, instead of the 40 tokens he purchased.

```solidity
  function initializeDistributionRecord(
    address beneficiary // the address that will receive tokens
  ) external validSaleParticipant(beneficiary) {
    _initializeDistributionRecord(beneficiary, getPurchasedAmount(beneficiary));
  }
```
```solidity
  function _initializeDistributionRecord(
    address beneficiary,
    uint256 totalAmount
  ) internal virtual override {
    super._initializeDistributionRecord(beneficiary, totalAmount);

    // add voting power through ERC20Votes extension
    _mint(beneficiary, tokensToVotes(totalAmount));
  }
```

## Impact
Wrong accounting of voting power when initializing a beneficiary, can lead to the user receiving more voting power than the amount he purchased in the first place.

## Tool used

Manual Review

## Recommendation
Track the purchased amount with mapping and mint voting power only for the additional tokens the user purchased.

```solidity
  function _initializeDistributionRecord(
    address beneficiary,
    uint256 totalAmount
  ) internal virtual override {
    super._initializeDistributionRecord(beneficiary, totalAmount);

+   uint256 purchasedAmount = lastPurchasedAmount[beneficiary];

    // add voting power through ERC20Votes extension
    _mint(beneficiary, tokensToVotes(purchasedAmount));

+   lastPurchasedAmount[beneficiary] = totalAmount;
  }
```
