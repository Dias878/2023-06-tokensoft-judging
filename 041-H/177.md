# User can initialize distribution record multiple times to extend his voting power.

## Summary
User can initialize distribution record multiple times to extend his voting power.

## Vulnerability Detail
The function initializeDistributionRecord can be called by anyone in order to set up the distribution record for the given beneficiary.

Looking at the function, there is no particular check to see if the beneficiary was initialized before, which means that the function can be called multiple times.
- In general this is the right thing to do, as no matter how many times the function is called the distribution record won't change if the purchased amount is the same.
- However even tho the distribution record doesn't change, the function will mint voting power for the corresponding purchased amount every time it's called. 

Duo to this issue beneficiary is able to increase his voting power, by initializing his distribution record multiple times.

```solidity
  function initializeDistributionRecord(
    address beneficiary // the address that will receive tokens
  ) external validSaleParticipant(beneficiary) {
    _initializeDistributionRecord(beneficiary, getPurchasedAmount(beneficiary));
  }
```
```solidity
  function _initializeDistributionRecord(
    address beneficiary,
    uint256 totalAmount
  ) internal virtual override {
    super._initializeDistributionRecord(beneficiary, totalAmount);

    // add voting power through ERC20Votes extension
    _mint(beneficiary, tokensToVotes(totalAmount));
  }
```
```solidity
  function _initializeDistributionRecord(
    address beneficiary,
    uint256 _totalAmount
  ) internal virtual {
    uint120 totalAmount = uint120(_totalAmount);

    // Checks
    require(totalAmount <= type(uint120).max, 'Distributor: totalAmount > type(uint120).max');

    // Effects - note that the existing claimed quantity is re-used during re-initialization
    records[beneficiary] = DistributionRecord(true, totalAmount, records[beneficiary].claimed);
    emit InitializeDistributionRecord(beneficiary, totalAmount);
  }
```

## Impact
A beneficiary is able to increase his voting power, as even tho the distribution record doesn't change if it was previously initialized with the same purchased amount. The function still mints the voting power for the purchased amount, so every time the function is called, it will still increase the voting power of the beneficiary.

## Tool used

Manual Review

## Recommendation
Recommend to not allow a beneficiary to be initialized multiple times with the same purchased amount. As an example a mapping can be made to store the last initialized value of the benificiary.

```solidity
  function initializeDistributionRecord(
    address beneficiary // the address that will receive tokens
  ) external validSaleParticipant(beneficiary) {
+   uint256 purchasedAmount = getPurchasedAmount(beneficiary);

+   require(lastInitialized[beneficiary] != purchasedAmount, "")

    _initializeDistributionRecord(beneficiary, purchasedAmount);
   
+   lastInitialized[beneficiary] = purchasedAmount;
  }
```
