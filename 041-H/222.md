# Unrestricted Access to initializeDistributionRecord Allows Manipulation of Voting Power

## Summary
In the function `initializeDistributionRecord`, which mints voting power equal to the total amount. Since there are no restrictions on calling this function, a user can potentially manipulate their voting power significantly.

## Vulnerability Detail
The function `initializeDistributionRecord` allows users to mint voting power equivalent to the total amount. However, this function can be called without any limitations. Therefore, it's possible for a user to arbitrarily call this function and drastically inflate their voting power. This could lead to potential voting manipulation and decision control within the system.

## Impact
User can manipulate own voting power.
