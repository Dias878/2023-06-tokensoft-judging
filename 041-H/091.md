# a user can mint unlimited voting tokens

## Summary
a user can mint unlimited voting tokens  through initializeDistributionRecord
## Vulnerability Detail
The function **initializeDistributionRecord** in **ContinuousVestingMerkle** is a public function which is used to set up a distribution for users and it will mint a voting token and since it is a public function and if a user is in the markelroot and can provide a markleproof  he just have to call it many times and each time it will mint tokensToVotes(totalAmount) since there is no check which will restrict the user from  not calling more than one time  
## Impact
Governance manipulation, lose of funds 
an attacker can propose a malicious propose and vote to it with his big weight of token so
