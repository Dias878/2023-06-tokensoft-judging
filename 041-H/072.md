# mint too much vote token in `AdvancedDistributor`

## Summary
The `_initializeDistributionRecord` function in `AdvancedDistributor` may mint too much vote token to a beneficiary.

## Vulnerability Detail

The ERC20 token of `AdvancedDistributor` is used to do some vote. It is expected to be propotional with record[beneficiary].total. The function `_initializeDistributionRecord(address beneficiary, uint256 totalAmount)` is supposed to set/update some beneficiary's totalAmount.

However, in `AdvancedDistributor._initializeDistributionRecord`, the vote token is minted to beneficiary every time this function is called. So if the owner just want to adjust someone's totalAmount claimable(for example, `ContinuousVestingMerkle.initializeDistributionRecord`), an unexpected amount of vote token is minted to the beneficiary, which can break the vote fuinctionality.

## Impact

Some beneficiary can get unexpected token of ERC20Vote .

## Recommendation
Remove the vote functionality. Or change the vote token amount(by _mint or _burn) based on existing `record[beneficiary].total`
