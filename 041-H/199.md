# can mint infinite vote tokens through signature and proof replay

## Summary
can mint infinite vote tokens through signature and proof replay

## Vulnerability Detail
initializeDistributionRecord function verifies the MerkleProof and mint Vote token. Users can repeatedly call this function as long as they have valid Merkle proof. Furthermore, if they repeatedly call Satellite.initiateClaim() with valid proof, they can execute xReceive on the Destination chain repeatedly to steal funds

Vulnerable scenario 1

1. initializeDistributionRecord() with valid proof
2. claimByMerkleProof()
3. initializeDistributionRecord() with valid proof, again
4. claimByMerkleProof()
5. repeat 1-4, until empty

Vulnerable scenario 2

1. initializeDistributionRecord() with valid proof, again and again
2. With lots of Vote Token, malicous user can manipulate the DAO voting.

## Impact
1. Infinite Voting power
2. steal all the funds that are allocated to other users.

## Tool used

Manual Review

## Recommendation
Make sure initializeDistributionRecord() is called once per proof.
