# Number of votes minted can be manipulated

# Votes can be manipulated

## Summary

When a userâ€™s record is initialized, some vote tokens are minted to them. However, in every distributor type except the BasicDistributor, it is possible to manipulate the number of tokens that are minted by calling `initializeDistributionRecord()` again.

## Vulnerability Detail

The underlying vulnerability exists because these distributor types e.g. `ContinuousVestingMerkle.sol`, `PriceTierVestingMerkle.sol` allow users to initialize their own distribution record. For example in `ContinuousVestingMerkle.sol`

```solidity
function initializeDistributionRecord(
    uint256 index, // the beneficiary's index in the merkle root
    address beneficiary, // the address that will receive tokens
    uint256 amount, // the total claimable by this beneficiary
    bytes32[] calldata merkleProof
)
    external
    validMerkleProof(keccak256(abi.encodePacked(index, beneficiary, amount)), merkleProof)
{
    _initializeDistributionRecord(beneficiary, amount);
} 
```

There is no check preventing the users from calling this function multiple times. While the initialized distribution record remains unchanged, more and more vote tokens will be minted to the user.

## Impact

Users will have more vote tokens than intended allowing them to manipulate the voting proposals.

## Tool used

Manual Review

## Recommendation

Users should only be allowed to manually initialize once. If any adjustments need to be made, the owner can perform the adjustment. You can also add a `batchAdjust()` function to adjust multiple records in a single transaction. For example
```solidity
// In AdvancedDistributor.sol
function _initializeDistributionRecord(
    address beneficiary,
    uint256 totalAmount
) internal virtual override {
    // Only mint vote tokens when the record is initialized for the first time
    // add voting power through ERC20Votes extension
    if !records[beneficiary].initialized _mint(beneficiary, tokensToVotes(totalAmount));
    super._initializeDistributionRecord(beneficiary, totalAmount);
}

function batchAdjust(
    address[] memory _beneficiaries,
    int256[] memory _amounts
) external onlyOwner {
    require(_beneficiaries.length == _amounts.length, "_beneficiaries, _amounts different lengths");
    for(uint256 i = 0; i < _beneficiaries.length) {
        adjust(_beneficiaries[i], _amounts[i]);
    }
    unchecked {
        ++i;
    }
}
```
