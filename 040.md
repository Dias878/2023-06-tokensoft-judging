# AdvancedDistributor.sol#adjust() - susceptible to front-running

## Summary
The ``adjust()`` function of the abstract AdvancedDistributor is used to adjust the token quantity claimable by a user, overriding the value in the distribution record. The function is susceptible to front-running.
## Vulnerability Detail
https://github.com/sherlock-audit/2023-06-tokensoft/blob/main/contracts/contracts/claim/abstract/AdvancedDistributor.sol#L105-L130
The function is protected by the ``onlyOwner`` modifier to protect against unauthorized increase in records, but there is a front-running pattern identical to the ``approve/transferFrom``:
    1. Alice initially gets a record with 100 claimable tokens.
    2. The owner decides to reduce her amount to 50 (so he would pass -50 as an amount)
    3. Alice sees his tx in the mempool and claims her tokens before the reduction
    4. The owner's tx reverts, due to arithmetic underflow 
## Impact
A user can sweep their tokens before their manual reduction by the owner, potentially costing funds, since there would be monetary reason for reducing a user's claimable amount.

## Tool used

Manual Review

## Recommendation
Integrate a commit/reveal scheme for operations that involve change of user sensitive variables, like tokens in the example.
