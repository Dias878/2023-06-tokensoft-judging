# All contracts implementing the AdvancedDistributor have two names

## Summary
All contracts implementing the AdvancedDistributor have two names. 
- A native name from the ERC20 votes contract and another name defined in  the Distributor.sol
## Vulnerability Detail
Although there seems to be an override function, the NAME() and the name() have different function selectors
- name() is 0x06fdde03
- NAME() is 0xa3f4df7e
## Impact
The contract inheriting the AdvancedDistributor.sol contracts all have two names, meaning all distributor contracts have two names.
