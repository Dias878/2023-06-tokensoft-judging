# Recipients in a CrosschainMerkleDistributor can mint themselves arbitrary amounts of voting tokens

## Summary

Any recipient of an airdrop can call `initializeDistributionRecord()` arbitrarily many times. Each time they call it, they get new voting tokens. This applies to all `Distributor`'s except BasicDistributor

## Vulnerability Detail

## Impact

There is no code that currently uses voting, so potentially none. Exception: if the ratio of voting tokens to airdrop tokens is high enough, then someone can potentially DOS the contract by bringing the total supply of tokens to new type(uint256).max, causing all future calls to `initializeDistributionRecord` to fail.

However, presumably the voting functionality exists for a reason, and will be used by other code. As the distributor contracts are not upgradeable, this means no fair elections can be run atop airdrops deployed with the current code.

On the other hand, it can also counteract vulnerabilities related to the voting token supply, for all `Distributor`'s except `BasicDistributor`. However, once this problem is fixed, all those other vulnerabilities will become more severe.

## Code Snippet

https://github.com/sherlock-audit/2023-06-tokensoft/blob/main/contracts/contracts/claim/abstract/CrosschainMerkleDistributor.sol#L46

```solidity

     function initializeDistributionRecord(
    uint32 _domain, // the domain of the beneficiary
    address _beneficiary, // the address that will receive tokens
    uint256 _amount, // the total claimable by this beneficiary
    bytes32[] calldata merkleProof
  ) external validMerkleProof(_getLeaf(_beneficiary, _amount, _domain), merkleProof) {
    _initializeDistributionRecord(_beneficiary, _amount);
  }
```

Note that this can be called many times in a row with the same parameters.

https://github.com/sherlock-audit/2023-06-tokensoft/blob/main/contracts/contracts/claim/abstract/AdvancedDistributor.sol#L77C1-L77C1

```solidity

  function _initializeDistributionRecord(
    address beneficiary,
    uint256 totalAmount
  ) internal virtual override {
    super._initializeDistributionRecord(beneficiary, totalAmount);

    // add voting power through ERC20Votes extension
    _mint(beneficiary, tokensToVotes(totalAmount));
  }
```

Each call mints new tokens.

## Recommendation

Don't use a separate token for voting.
