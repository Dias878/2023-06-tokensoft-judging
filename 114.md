# The `claimed` amount could be greater than the `total` claimable amount in the `AdvancedDistributor` contract

## Summary

The current validation for adjusting the claimable amount by the owner only checks if the `total` is greater than the `diff` in the `adjust` function.
However, this approach could lead to issues if the `claimed` amount is not zero. 
In such cases, the `claimed` amount may exceed the `total` claimable amount, causing logic problems when using these values in other contracts.

The possibility also exists in the `_setTotal` function. (https://github.com/sherlock-audit/2023-06-tokensoft/blob/main/contracts/contracts/claim/abstract/AdvancedDistributor.sol#L145)

It is recommended to revise the validation process to address this potential problem and ensure accurate calculations of claimable amounts.

```solidity
File: contracts/contracts/claim/abstract/AdvancedDistributor.sol#L105-L130
    function adjust(address beneficiary, int256 amount) external onlyOwner {
        DistributionRecord memory distributionRecord = records[beneficiary];
        require(distributionRecord.initialized, 'must initialize before adjusting');

        uint256 diff = uint256(amount > 0 ? amount : -amount);
        require(diff < type(uint120).max, 'adjustment > max uint120'); // @audit should be <=

        if (amount < 0) {
        // decreasing claimable tokens
        require(total >= diff, 'decrease greater than distributor total'); // @audit should be checked total-claimed >= diff
        require(distributionRecord.total >= diff, 'decrease greater than distributionRecord total');
        total -= diff;
        records[beneficiary].total -= uint120(diff);
        token.safeTransfer(owner(), diff);
        // reduce voting power
        _burn(beneficiary, tokensToVotes(diff));
        } else {
        // increasing claimable tokens
        total += diff;
        records[beneficiary].total += uint120(diff);
        // increase voting pwoer
        _mint(beneficiary, tokensToVotes(diff));
        }

        emit Adjust(beneficiary, amount);
    }

```

## Impact

This may cause the logic problem using this `total` and `claimed` value in other contracts.

## Tool used

Manual Review

## Recommendation

Recommend enhancing the validation process of the validity of the `diff` and adding the validation steps in the `_setTotal`.
