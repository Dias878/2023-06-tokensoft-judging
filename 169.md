# USDT: set allowance to be 0 first

## Summary
To approve tokens like USDT, set their allowance to 0 first and then approve with the intended amount.

## Vulnerability Detail
Some tokens like USDT require that the allowance should be set to 0 first and then be set to the new value. This means if you’re only using approve and not resetting the allowance, you won’t be able to allow a different amount until the allowance is reset first. The protocol intends on using standard ERC20 tokens. So, this scenario should be taken into consideration. The `_setTotal` function of `CrosschainDistributor` calls the `_allowConnext` with the argument `total - claimed`. It should call the same function but with argument 0 first and then with the argument `total - claimed`. Also, the protocol should stop using `safeApprove` as Openzeppelin has deprecated it.

## Impact
It won't be possible to set a new `total` value for ERC20 tokens like USDT.

## Tool used

Manual Review

## Recommendation
The protocol should not use `safeApprove`. It has been deprecated. A normal `approve` would suffice, since the approval is only meant for Connext which is trusted. Or they may choose to use `safeIncreaseAllowance` and `safeDecreaseAllowance`. If they use approve, then the following lines have to be added in the `_setTotal` function.

```solidity
_allowConnext(0);
_allowConnext(total - claimed);
```
