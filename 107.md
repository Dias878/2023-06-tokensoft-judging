# Potential inacurate distribution of tokens

## Summary
The `_executeClaim` function in the `Distributor` contract is at risk of a potential overflow due to the manipulation of `uint120` variables. This function is responsible for recording claims made by beneficiaries but lacks proper checks to prevent an overflow when updating the `claimed` amount for a beneficiary.
## Vulnerability Detail
The `_executeClaim` function allows beneficiaries to claim their allocated tokens. However, there is a vulnerability in the addition of the `claimableAmount` to the `claimed` amount for a beneficiary. Here is the relevant code snippet:
```solidity
function _executeClaim(address beneficiary, uint256 _totalAmount) internal virtual returns (uint256) {
    uint120 totalAmount = uint120(_totalAmount);

    // effects
    if (records[beneficiary].total != totalAmount) {
        // re-initialize if the total has been updated
        _initializeDistributionRecord(beneficiary, totalAmount);
    }
    
    uint120 claimableAmount = uint120(getClaimableAmount(beneficiary));
    require(claimableAmount > 0, 'Distributor: no more tokens claimable right now');

    records[beneficiary].claimed += claimableAmount;
    claimed += claimableAmount;

    return claimableAmount;
}
```
The issue arises because both `records[beneficiary].claimed` and `claimableAmount` are of type `uint120`. If the sum of these two values exceeds the maximum value that a `uint120` can hold (`2^120 - 1`), an overflow will occur, and the value will wrap around to zero.
## Impact
If an overflow occurs in the `_executeClaim` function, the `claimed` amount for a beneficiary will be incorrect, leading to an inaccurate distribution of tokens. This can cause financial losses for legitimate beneficiaries, disrupt the distribution process, and potentially undermine the contract's integrity.

Manual Review

## Recommendation
 it is recommended to use a larger data type, such as `uint256`
