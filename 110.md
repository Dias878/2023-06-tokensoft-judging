# Insecure Merkle Proof Validation in ContinuousVestingMerkle Contract

## Summary
The `ContinuousVestingMerkle` contract utilizes Merkle proofs to verify the eligibility of beneficiaries during distribution initialization and token claims. However, there is a flaw in the implementation of Merkle proof validation, potentially enabling unauthorized access to vested tokens or manipulation of distribution records.
## Vulnerability Detail
The vulnerability lies in the `initializeDistributionRecord` and `claim` functions of the `ContinuousVestingMerkle` contract. These functions rely on Merkle proofs provided by beneficiaries to establish their eligibility for vested tokens. Let's examine the vulnerability in each function:
`initializeDistributionRecord`
The purpose of this function is to allow a beneficiary to initialize their distribution record and become eligible to claim tokens later when the vesting conditions are met. The function requires the beneficiary to provide a Merkle proof as evidence of their membership in the Merkle tree.
```solidity
function initializeDistributionRecord(
  uint256 index,
  address beneficiary,
  uint256 amount,
  bytes32[] calldata merkleProof
)
external
validMerkleProof(keccak256(abi.encodePacked(index, beneficiary, amount)), merkleProof)
{
  _initializeDistributionRecord(beneficiary, amount);
}

```
The vulnerability in this function is that it calculates the hash of the beneficiary's index, address, and the amount they are eligible to claim. However, the actual validity of the Merkle proof is not verified within the function. If an attacker provides an invalid Merkle proof, they might be able to initialize their distribution record and later claim tokens that they are not entitled to.
`claim`
The purpose of this function is to enable beneficiaries to `claim` their vested tokens. Like the `initializeDistributionRecord` function, the `claim` function also requires a Merkle proof from the beneficiary.
```solidity
function claim(
  uint256 index,
  address beneficiary,
  uint256 totalAmount,
  bytes32[] calldata merkleProof
)
external
validMerkleProof(keccak256(abi.encodePacked(index, beneficiary, totalAmount)), merkleProof)
nonReentrant
{
  uint256 claimedAmount = super._executeClaim(beneficiary, totalAmount);
  super._settleClaim(beneficiary, claimedAmount);
}

```
Similarly, the vulnerability lies in the lack of explicit Merkle proof validation within the function. An attacker could exploit this vulnerability to provide a forged Merkle proof, leading to the unauthorized claim of tokens or claiming a larger amount than they are eligible for.
## Impact
The vulnerability could result in unauthorized access to vested tokens and manipulation of distribution records. Malicious actors could claim tokens they are not entitled to, leading to an unfair distribution of tokens and potential financial losses for legitimate beneficiaries.

## Tool used

Manual Review

## Recommendation
1. Modify the `initializeDistributionRecord` function:
```solidity
function initializeDistributionRecord(
  uint256 index,
  address beneficiary,
  uint256 amount,
  bytes32[] calldata merkleProof
)
external
{
  require(isValidMerkleProof(index, beneficiary, amount, merkleProof), "Invalid Merkle proof");
  _initializeDistributionRecord(beneficiary, amount);
}

```
2. Modify the `claim` function:
```solidity
function claim(
  uint256 index,
  address beneficiary,
  uint256 totalAmount,
  bytes32[] calldata merkleProof
)
external
nonReentrant
{
  require(isValidMerkleProof(index, beneficiary, totalAmount, merkleProof), "Invalid Merkle proof");
  uint256 claimedAmount = super._executeClaim(beneficiary, totalAmount);
  super._settleClaim(beneficiary, claimedAmount);
}

```
3. Add a new internal function isValidMerkleProof to validate the Merkle proof:
```solidity
function isValidMerkleProof(
  uint256 index,
  address beneficiary,
  uint256 amount,
  bytes32[] calldata merkleProof
)
internal view returns (bool)
{
  bytes32 leaf = keccak256(abi.encodePacked(index, beneficiary, amount));
  return MerkleSet.verify(merkleProof, merkleRoot, leaf);
}

```
