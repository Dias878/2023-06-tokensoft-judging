# `_setToken` during claim process can cause strange behaviour

## Summary

`_setToken` during claim process can cause strange behaviour

## Vulnerability Detail

There is a `setToken` external funtion in `Advcanced Distributor`. If the `token` is changed during claim, there may be many unexpected behaviour. For example,  if I changed the token from ETH to USDC, claimed amount in ETH is 1 * 10 ** 18, while 1 * 10 ** 18 in USDC is 10 ** 12 $. The total can be changed but the claimed seems cannot be changed. But the expected behaviour should be all previous token swept and claim is zeroed.

After discussing with the protocol staff, she agree that token should not be changed during the claim and think this as an issue.

Therefore, I submit it as medium, since it cause unexpected behaviour.

## Impact

Token claimed become strange after `setToken` in the middle of claim.

## Tool used

Manual Review

## Recommendation
Consider redesign the `setToken` function to meet the requirement of changing token after initialization, or delete the `setToken` external interface, only `_setToken` in constructor.
