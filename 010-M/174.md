# Same signature can be reused for multiple claims, leading to unintended fund distributions.

## Summary
The contractt does not enforce uniqueness for signatures used in the claimBySignature function.
## Vulnerability Detail
The attacker submits a legitimate claim for a specific beneficiary and receives the funds.
The attacker then reuses the same signature for another claim, but this time changes the recipient address and domain to their own.
The contract will validate the signature, believe it's legitimate, and distribute the funds to the attacker's address, even though they are not the intended beneficiary.
## Impact
If an attacker obtains a valid signature for one claim, they can use that signature to claim funds multiple times leading to loss of funds
