# claimBySignature vulnerable to replay attacks

## Summary
If a beneficiary signs a message designating a recipient to claim their vesting at a point in time, they beneficiary can then replay this signature unlimited times to vest all the beneficiary tokens to himself.

## Vulnerability Detail
[The messaged signed by the beneficiary](https://github.com/sherlock-audit/2023-06-tokensoft/blob/main/contracts/contracts/claim/abstract/CrosschainMerkleDistributor.sol#L129-L131) designating a recipient to claim their tokens does not include any unique information and can be replayed.

## Impact
Once a signature is signed by a beneficiary, it can be reused unlimited times to potentially claim all of the beneficiary's tokens, even if the tokens were intended to be claimed only once.

## Code Snippet
``bytes32 _signed = keccak256(
      abi.encodePacked(_recipient, _recipientDomain, _beneficiary, _beneficiaryDomain, _total)
    );
``

## Tool used
Manual Review

## Recommendation
Include a nonce in the signature to ensure its uniqueness.
