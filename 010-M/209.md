# Signature Replay in the claimBySignature() function

## Summary
The ClaimBySignature() is vulnerable to Signature Replay where a single signature gives the ability to claim tokens multiple times for the same total. 
## Vulnerability Detail
The claimBySignautre() function is part of the CrosschainMerkleDistributor contract.

It gives a beneficiary the ability to claim his tokens to another account but also the ability to allow someone else to claim his tokens.
The problem is that there is no tracking of whether a signature has already been used. 
```solidity
function claimBySignature(
    address _recipient,
    uint32 _recipientDomain,
    address _beneficiary,
    uint32 _beneficiaryDomain,
    uint256 _total,
    bytes calldata _signature,
    bytes32[] calldata _proof
  ) external {
    // Recover the signature by beneficiary
    bytes32 _signed = keccak256(
      abi.encodePacked(_recipient, _recipientDomain, _beneficiary, _beneficiaryDomain, _total)
    );
    address recovered = _recoverSignature(_signed, _signature);
    require(recovered == _beneficiary, '!recovered');

    // Validate the claim
    _verifyMembership(_getLeaf(_beneficiary, _total, _beneficiaryDomain), _proof);
    uint256 claimedAmount = _executeClaim(_beneficiary, _total);

    _settleClaim(_beneficiary, _recipient, _recipientDomain, claimedAmount);
  }
```

If Bob signs a transaction for Alice to claim his tokens, he would expect Alice to be able to get the currently available tokens.
Alice calls claimBySignature(). Then 30 days later a new tranche is unlocked and without Bob's knowledge, Alice calls claimBySignature() again and claims more of Bob's tokens.
## Impact
A user who has received a signature, can claim more tokens than what the beneficiary intended to give him.

## Tool used

Manual Review

## Recommendation
Consider the desired behavior of the claimBySignature() function and implement necessary checks.
An example solution would be to include a deadline with the signature to prevent claiming over multiple tranches.
