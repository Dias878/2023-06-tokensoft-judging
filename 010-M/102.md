# `claimBySignature()` implementation is vulnerable to replay attacks

## Summary
The `CrosschainMerkleDistributor.claimBySignature()` function is vulnerable to replay attacks.

## Vulnerability Detail
The `CrosschainMerkleDistributor.claimBySignature()` function is vulnerable to replay attacks as the signature is constructed only with:
```solidity
bytes32 _signed = keccak256(
    abi.encodePacked(_recipient, _recipientDomain, _beneficiary, _beneficiaryDomain, _total)
);
```

These contracts inherit from the `CrosschainMerkleDistributor` contract:
- `CrosschainContinuousVestingMerkle`
- `CrosschainTrancheVestingMerkle`

So, in the case that the `CrosschainContinuousVestingMerkle` and the `CrosschainTrancheVestingMerkle` contract had in their merkle trees a leaf with the same `_beneficiary, _beneficiaryDomain, _total` the signature created by the `beneficiary` for the `recipient` in the `CrosschainContinuousVestingMerkle` could be reused in the `CrosschainTrancheVestingMerkle` and viceversa.

## Impact
In an edge case scenario, a malicious `recipient` could double-claim the airdropped tokens through the `claimBySignature()` function.

## Tool used
Manual Review

## Recommendation
As a minimum, consider adding the `CrosschainContinuousVestingMerkle`/`CrosschainTrancheVestingMerkle` contract address to the `_signed` hash. A nonce, a proper domain separator etc. could also be appropiate.
