# Merkle leaf values in `validMerkleProof()` are 84 bytes before hashing which can lead to merkle tree collisions

## Summary

## Vulnerability Detail
MerkleProofUpgradeable.sol puts the following warning at the beginning of the contract:
* WARNING: You should avoid using leaf values that are 64 bytes long prior to
 * hashing, or use a hash function other than keccak256 for hashing leaves.
 * This is because the concatenation of a sorted pair of internal nodes in
 * the merkle tree could be reinterpreted as a leaf value.

```solidity
function initializeDistributionRecord(
    uint256 index, // the beneficiary's index in the merkle root
    address beneficiary, // the address that will receive tokens
    uint256 amount, // the total claimable by this beneficiary
    bytes32[] calldata merkleProof
  )
    external
    validMerkleProof(keccak256(abi.encodePacked(index, beneficiary, amount)), merkleProof)
....
....
```
Here in function `initializeDistributionRecord()` This use 
`uint256 index` which 32bytes
`address beneficiary` which 20bytes
`uint256 amount` which 32bytes

This allows collision between leaves and internal nodes.
And There are multiple instances of this type.
## Impact
Users can abuse merkle tree collisions

## Recommendation
Use a combination of variables that doesn't sum to 64 bytes
