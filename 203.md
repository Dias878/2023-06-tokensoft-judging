# Potential Token Theft Risk Due to Signature Reuse in CrosschainMerkleDistributor

## Summary
There is a risk that the beneficiary's signature can be reused to steal assets in certain scenarios, especially when the same beneficiary is included in different airdrop events.

## Vulnerability Detail
Here's an example scenario illustrating the vulnerability:

1. In an airdrop event, User A is allocated 1000 of token A.
2. User B purchases the signature of User A for a certain price.
3. Using User A's signature, User B claims the airdrop of token A.
4. In another airdrop event, User A is allocated 1000 of token B.
5. User B checks User A's proof and reuses the signature to steal 1000 token B.

In this scenario, since the signature of User A does not change, it allows User B to reuse it to claim airdrops not intended for them. This vulnerability can be exploited by malicious actors to steal assets.

## Impact
Funds can be stolen through signature reuse.
