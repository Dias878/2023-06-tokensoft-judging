# Lack of relayer fee payment

## Summary
The _settleClaim function in CrosschainDistributor contract does not allows users to set a relayer fee.
## Vulnerability Detail
According to the Connext docs, the relayer fee is a charge imposed by relayers for executing transactions on the destination chain, which can be paid in either the native asset of the origin or the transacting asset. However, the current implementation of the [CrosschainDistributor._settleClaim](https://github.com/sherlock-audit/2023-06-tokensoft/blob/main/contracts/contracts/claim/abstract/CrosschainDistributor.sol#L68-L87) does not include passing the relayer fee at all.
## Impact
The claim settlement functionality does not work as intended.
## Code Snippet
```solidity
      id = connext.xcall(
        _recipientDomain, // destination domain
        _recipient, // to
        address(token), // asset
        _recipient, // delegate, only required for self-execution + slippage
        _amount, // amount
        0, // slippage -- assumes no pools on connext
        bytes('') // calldata
      );
```

Manual Review

## Recommendation
Allow sending the relayer fee either in native asset or the transacting asset.
