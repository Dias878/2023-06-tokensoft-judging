# `_settleClaim` in `CrosschainDistributor` will always fail for cross chain claims because tokens have different addresses across different chains

## Summary

`_settleClaim` in `CrosschainDistributor` uses the same token address for sending tokens on the chain the distributor is deployed and when settling cross chain claims. Since tokens have different addresses on different chains the cross-chain settlement will fail.

## Vulnerability Detail

See summery

## Impact

Cross chain settlements can not be executed meaning recepients can not claim their tokens

## Tool used

Manual Review

## Recommendation

Have a mapping of the different accaptable domains/chains mapped to the token addresses at this domain/chains so the right address can be looked up and used for cross chain claims
