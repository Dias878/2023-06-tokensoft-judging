# Cross-chain replay attacks are possible because missing `chainId`

## Summary

Cross-chain replay attacks are possible because missing `chainId` in `claimBySignature()` and `initiateClaim()`

## Vulnerability Detail

From the readme, we see:

> On what chains are the smart contracts going to be deployed?
> - Arbitrum, Optimism, Gnosis, Polygon

According to [EIP4337](https://eips.ethereum.org/EIPS/eip-4337)Â standard to prevent replay attacks the signature should depend on `chainId`. But in these functions, `chainId` is not used. A valid signature that was used on one chain could be copied by an attacker and propagated onto another chain.

## Impact

Lack of `chainId` can lead to Cross-chain replay attacks
