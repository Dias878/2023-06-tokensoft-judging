# CrosschainMerkleDistributor's claimBySignature allows for signatures replay across airdrops

## Summary
CrosschainMerkleDistributor allows a `recipient` actor to claim aidrops on behalf of a `beneficiary` by providing a signature acting as proof of their consent. This signature can be replayed across multiple airdrops, likely against the signer's (`beneficiary`) intention.

## Vulnerability Detail
The `beneficiary` signs the proof-of-consent payload, which is their own address/domain, the `recipient` address/domain, and the token `amount`. In the signed proof [there is however no information that unambiguously binds the signature to the airdrop itself](https://github.com/sherlock-audit/2023-06-tokensoft/blob/main/contracts/contracts/claim/abstract/CrosschainMerkleDistributor.sol#L130).

## Impact
The `recipient` can replay their proof-of-consent to claim any future airdrops intended for `beneficiary`, under the condition that the new airdrop awards `beneficiary` the same amount of tokens. Without knowledge of how are airdrop amounts computed, the situation of having the same amounts delivered through different airdrops does not seem a reasonably unlikely coincidence to not require additional replay protection.

## Code Snippet
```Solidity
  function claimBySignature(
    address _recipient,
    uint32 _recipientDomain,
    address _beneficiary,
    uint32 _beneficiaryDomain,
    uint256 _total,
    bytes calldata _signature,
    bytes32[] calldata _proof
  ) external {
    // Recover the signature by beneficiary
    bytes32 _signed = keccak256(
      abi.encodePacked(_recipient, _recipientDomain, _beneficiary, _beneficiaryDomain, _total)
    );
    address recovered = _recoverSignature(_signed, _signature);
    require(recovered == _beneficiary, '!recovered');

    // Validate the claim
    _verifyMembership(_getLeaf(_beneficiary, _total, _beneficiaryDomain), _proof);
    uint256 claimedAmount = _executeClaim(_beneficiary, _total);

    _settleClaim(_beneficiary, _recipient, _recipientDomain, claimedAmount);
  }
```

## Tool used
Manual Review

## Recommendation
Add airdrop-specific information to the signed proof required in `clainBySignature`, i.e. the Merkle root or the proof contents.

This change would increase security but at some price to practicality: `CrosschainMerkleDistributor` allows for changing the Merkle root, and when this happens signatures that would otherwise be still valid would be no longer valid.
