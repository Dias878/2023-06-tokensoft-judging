# Report on Potential Double Spending Vulnerability in Contract Function _settleClaim

## Summary
The contract contains a function named _settleClaim which settles claimed tokens to any valid Connext domain. Upon closer inspection, a potential double spending vulnerability has been identified within the function's logic. 
If exploited, this vulnerability could allow malicious actors to double spend tokens, compromising the integrity of the contract's token settlement process.

## Vulnerability Detail
The vulnerability arises when the _recipientDomain parameter of the _settleClaim function is not equal to 0 and is different from the current domain of the contract. In this scenario, the function proceeds with a cross-chain transaction using the connext.xcall function to transfer tokens to another domain.
The issue is that there is no apparent mechanism in place to prevent multiple calls to the _settleClaim function with the same _beneficiary and _recipientDomain combination. This lack of validation opens the door for potential double spending attacks, where malicious actors can repeatedly execute the function to claim tokens and settle them to the same destination, leading to an unauthorized issuance of tokens.

## Impact
If the double spending vulnerability is exploited successfully, the consequences could be severe. Malicious actors could create a situation where the same tokens are transferred multiple times to the same _recipient and _recipientDomain, leading to a loss of funds or the over-issuance of tokens. Such an attack would undermine the trust in the contract and its associated financial systems, potentially causing financial losses to legitimate users and negatively impacting the project's reputation.

## Code Snippet
https://github.com/sherlock-audit/2023-06-tokensoft/blob/main/contracts/contracts/claim/abstract/CrosschainDistributor.sol#L68

     function _settleClaim(
    address _beneficiary,
    address _recipient,
    uint32 _recipientDomain,
    uint256 _amount
    ) internal virtual {
    bytes32 id;
    if (_recipientDomain == 0 || _recipientDomain == domain) {
     token.safeTransfer(_recipient, _amount);
    } else {
       id = connext.xcall(
       _recipientDomain, // destination domain
        _recipient, // to
        address(token), // asset
       _recipient, // delegate, only required for self-execution + slippage
       _amount, // amount
       0, // slippage -- assumes no pools on connext
       bytes('') // calldata
     );
     }
    emit CrosschainClaim(id, _beneficiary, _recipient, _recipientDomain, _amount);
    }

## Tool used
Manual Review

## Recommendation
Introduce a mapping to track whether the _beneficiary and _recipientDomain combination has already been processed. Before executing the cross-chain transaction, verify that the claim has not been settled previously for the given combination.
