# A malicious user can burn another user's  voting power

## Summary

A malicious user can burn another user's  voting power

## Vulnerability Detail

The `claim()` function allows a beneficiary (or any external caller) to claim tokens on behalf of a beneficiary. A malicious user can exploit this by calling a function with the victim's address. The function call `_executeClaim()`:

```solidity
function _executeClaim(
    address beneficiary,
    uint256 totalAmount
  ) internal virtual override returns (uint256 _claimed) {
    _claimed = super._executeClaim(beneficiary, totalAmount);

    // reduce voting power through ERC20Votes extension
    _burn(beneficiary, tokensToVotes(_claimed));
  }
```

Note that the function not only claims the tokens but then burns voting power. 
Thus an honest user can fall victim to a malicious user and burns voting power when the user does not want this to happen. 
Note also that `_executeClaim()` is also called by other functions, so special attention should be paid to other places to see if a similar scenario is possible.
