# Airdrop recipients can prevent owner from ever decreasing their share

## Summary

The contract provides a mechanism for the owner to increase or decrease the share of any airdrop recipient. However, by stashing their voting tokens, any recipient can easily prevent the owner from ever decreasing their share

## Vulnerability Detail

Worst case scenario below:

1. Airdrop is created; 1000 people get claim to 1 billion tokens each, and 1 trillion tokens are minted to the distributor. They each instantly receive a corresponding amount of voting tokens
2. A selfish user moves his voting tokens to another address
3. Before anyone has vested, creator decides to change the token supply, and reduce everyone's share to 1 million
4. Creator sweeps all but 1 billion of the the tokens out of the airdrop and burns them. Creator then `adjust`'s everyone's claim down to 1 million tokens.
5. However, this transaction reverts for the selfish user. There are now only 1 billion tokens in the contract, and the selfish user has a claim to all of them. Upon vesting, the selfish user is able to claim everyone else's tokens. (They will need to transfer back their voting tokens to do so.)

## Impact

Selfish users can keep a high share of tokens even if the creator wants to reduce claims

## Code Snippet

https://github.com/sherlock-audit/2023-06-tokensoft/blob/main/contracts/contracts/claim/abstract/AdvancedDistributor.sol#L112-L121

```solidity
    if (amount < 0) {
      // decreasing claimable tokens
      require(total >= diff, 'decrease greater than distributor total');
      require(distributionRecord.total >= diff, 'decrease greater than distributionRecord total');
      total -= diff;
      records[beneficiary].total -= uint120(diff);
      token.safeTransfer(owner(), diff);
      // reduce voting power
      _burn(beneficiary, tokensToVotes(diff));
    } else {
```

The call to `_burn` reverts if a user has stashed away their voting tokens in another address.

## Tool used

Manual Review

## Recommendation

Several options are available, though none are trivial. There are several comments suggesting the goal to base votes on unclaimed tokens, and not to have these votes be transferable. No separate voting token is needed to do this.
