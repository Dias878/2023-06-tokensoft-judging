# Unclaimed vested tokens can be locked again if setVestingConfig is updated

## Summary

If the owner were to call `setVestingConfig()` halfway through a vesting period, unclaimed vested tokens may be locked again because it is considered unvested according to the new config.

## Vulnerability Detail

This is not a vulnerability per se but more of a design choice. Since the owner is allowed to update the vesting config, if the owner chooses to update the vesting config to a different vesting while a vesting period is in the process, vested tokens become automatically locked because the new config is applied retroactively.

## Impact

Vested tokens can become unvested again thus causing the users to temporarily “lose” their assets.  This is an opportunity cost for the users.

## Tool used

Manual Review

## Recommendation

SetVestingConfig should not be modified while a vesting period has started. If owners must have the ability to modify the vesting config whilst it is ongoing then it needs to track how many % has been vested already and use the remainder for the new vesting period.
