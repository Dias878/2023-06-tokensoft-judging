# `sweepNative()` in `Sweepable` is missing `onlyOwner` modifier allowing anyone to send all native token amount to owner potentially breaking core functionality of the distributor or any other inherited contract

## Summary

`Sweepable` allows to sweep different tokens, including native ones, to the owner of the smart contract. All functions of the contract are restricted to be called by owner only, however `sweepNative()` function is missing the check, allowing anyone to call it and send all smart contract native token (e.g. ETH) to owner.

While this doesn't lose the funds directly, it can break core functionality or lead to complex situations resulting in funds loss of any smart contract inheriting from `Sweepable`. For example, if Distributor contract is extended to airdrop native token, any user will be able to DOS its service by sweeping all native token thus making all claims fail because smart contract won't have enough funds to pay out to users.

## Vulnerability Detail

Notice the absence of `onlyOwner` modifier in the sweepNative() implementation:
```solidity
    function sweepNative() external {
        uint256 amount = address(this).balance;
        (bool success, ) = recipient.call{value: amount}("");
        require(success, "Transfer failed.");
        emit SweepNative(amount);
    }
```
This makes it possible to call `sweepNative()` by any user.

## Impact

`Sweepable` functionality is mostly intended to be used in emergency or extremely rare situations. It is usually not intended to be used by anyone, as such sweeping all native funds in a normal protocol operation can easily break all core functionality (all transactions will revert due to not enough funds) or even lead to direct funds loss in certain circumstances.

## Recommendation

Add `onlyOwner` modifier to `sweepNative()`:
```solidity
    function sweepNative() external onlyOwner {
```
