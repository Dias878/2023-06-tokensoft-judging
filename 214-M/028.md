# Sweepable's sweepNative function can be called by a malicious user

## Summary
The `Sweepable.sol` contract provides utility methods to sweep ERC-20 and native tokens from a contract to a trusted recipient. All sweeps can be initiated only by the trusted `owner` of the contract, except for `sweepNative`, which [is open to be called by anyone](https://github.com/sherlock-audit/2023-06-tokensoft/blob/main/contracts/contracts/utilities/Sweepable.sol#L34).

## Vulnerability Detail
A malicious user can call `sweepNative` to entirely deprive any child contract of the entirety of its native token balance. If this child contract needs to hold a non-zero native token balance to function correctly, it will become insolvent, making this become a viable way for a DoS attack. The DoS duration is not known upfront, because it depends on when the beneficiary of the sweep is able to move back the funds, so it's not guaranteed to be less than 1 year.

## Impact
Any contract inheriting from `Sweepable` that needs to hold a non-zero native token balance to work is vulnerable to a DoS attack.

## Code Snippet
```Solidity
    // sweep native token to the recipient (public function)
    function sweepNative() external {
        uint256 amount = address(this).balance;
        (bool success, ) = recipient.call{value: amount}("");
        require(success, "Transfer failed.");
        emit SweepNative(amount);
    }
```

## Tool used
Manual Review

## Recommendation
Make the `sweepNative` function `onlyOwner`, in accordance with all other external functions of the `Sweepable` contract.
