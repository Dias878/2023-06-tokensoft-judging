# `CrosschainDistributor._setToken` might become unusable due to dependency upon successful interaction with old token

## Summary
The successful execution of `CrosschainDistributor._setToken` is dependent upon a successful decrease allowance call on the previous token. This will cause issues if call to previous token reverts or returns false. 

## Vulnerability Detail
The external `setToken` function internally invokes the `_setTotal` function.

```solidity
  function _setToken(IERC20 _token) internal virtual override nonReentrant onlyOwner {
    // decrease allowance on old token
    _allowConnext(0);

    // effect
    super._setToken(_token);

    // increase allowance on new token
    _allowConnext(total - claimed);
  }
```

The presence of `setToken` is for providing the ability to change `token` to airdrop owners in case when the old token starts behaving incorrectly (possibly due to misconfiguration, bug, exploit, etc). So that the old token can be replaced with a new token.

However this replacement mechanism itself depends upon a successful execution of oldToken.approve call.

In case the old token:
- reverts the `approve` call
- returns `false` on `approve` call
- is selfdestructed

The `setToken` call will also get reverted preventing owners from changing the `token`.


## Impact
Tokensoft airdrop protocol is meant to be used by other protocols for launching their token airdrops and the ability to change `token` in case of emergencies is an intended offering.

This report explains how this offering can be blocked which results in owners not able to change token.

Manual Review

## Recommendation

Consider wrapping the first approve call to the old token in a `try {}` block so that unexpected response can be handled properly.
