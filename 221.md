# Lack of proper validation in proof verification for Merkle distribution

## Summary

Both `ContinuousVestingMerkle.sol` and `PriceTierVestingMerkle.sol` use a Merkle proof for token distribution. This Merkle proof is used to claim tokens by providing a valid leaf node (composed of index, beneficiary, and totalAmount). However, these contracts lack proper validation checks which could eventually allow an attacker to claim tokens that they shouldn't be entitled to.

## Vulnerability Detail

In both `ContinuousVestingMerkle.sol` and `PriceTierVestingMerkle.sol` contracts, the `initializeDistributionRecord` and `claim` functions accept a `merkleProof` as an argument. This proof is then passed to the `validMerkleProof` modifier for validation. However, the `validMerkleProof` modifier only verifies the provided proof against the current Merkle root, but doesn't ensure that the leaf hasn't been used before.

This means that an attacker could use the same `merkleProof` to claim tokens multiple times, draining the contract of its tokens.

## Impact

If an attacker finds a valid leaf (through off-chain means) and its corresponding proof, they could potentially drain all the tokens in the contract by repeatedly claiming the same tokens.

## Code Snippet

In `ContinuousVestingMerkle.sol` and `PriceTierVestingMerkle.sol` contracts, the vulnerability lies in the `claim` and `initializeDistributionRecord` functions:

```solidity
 function initializeDistributionRecord(
 uint256 index, 
 address beneficiary, 
 uint256 amount, 
 bytes32[] calldata merkleProof
 )
 external
 validMerkleProof(keccak256(abi.encodePacked(index, beneficiary, amount)), merkleProof)
 {
 _initializeDistributionRecord(beneficiary, amount);
 }

 function claim(
 uint256 index, 
 address beneficiary, 
 uint256 totalAmount, 
 bytes32[] calldata merkleProof
 )
 external
 validMerkleProof(keccak256(abi.encodePacked(index, beneficiary, totalAmount)), merkleProof)
 nonReentrant
 {

 uint256 claimedAmount = _executeClaim(beneficiary, totalAmount);

 _settleClaim(beneficiary, claimedAmount);
 }
```

## Tool used

Manual Review

## Recommendation

Consider maintaining a mapping of all the used leaf nodes and check against this mapping before allowing token claims. This will prevent multiple claims using the same proof.

## Proof Of Concept

1. Deploy the ContinuousVestingMerkle contract or PriceTierVestingMerkle contract with the proper parameters.
2. Find a valid leaf node and its corresponding proof (off-chain computation required).
3. Call the `initializeDistributionRecord` function with the index, beneficiary address, amount, and merkle proof as parameters.
4. Observe that the function call is successful.
5. Call the `claim` function with the same index, beneficiary address, amount, and merkle proof.
6. Observe that the function call is successful and tokens are transferred to the beneficiary address.
7. Repeat steps 5 and 6. Note that the same tokens can be claimed multiple times, draining the contract balance.
