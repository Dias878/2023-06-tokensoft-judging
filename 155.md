# settle claim fails when distribution  doesn’t haven enough token.

## Summary
settle claim fails when distribution  doesn’t haven enough token.

## Vulnerability Detail
The settle claim functions transfers tokens to the user but it doesn’t verify if it has enough token to send which will fail. This come in handy with adjust function 
https://github.com/sherlock-audit/2023-06-tokensoft/blob/main/contracts/contracts/claim/abstract/AdvancedDistributor.sol#L105 
 which send back token to the owner when decreasing  but when increasing does not increase, meaning a beneficiary can claim more tokens than the total originally sent to the distributor. 
## Impact
In a case whereby owner doesnt have enough token to send to the distributor  then some user are denied to claim .

## Tool used

Manual Review

## Recommendation
Transferring tokens when adjusting a beneficiary totals  and verifing tokens in distributor are >= totals . worst case scenario check if tokens are available and handle errors
