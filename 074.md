# Due to the lack of functionality to increase Relayer Fees it is possible that the transaction will get stuck

## Summary

Due to the lack of functionality to increase **Relayer Fees** it is possible that the transaction will get stuck

## Vulnerability Detail

The `initiateClaim()` function call `xcall()`:

```solidity
87:    // Send claim to distributor via crosschain call
88:    bytes32 transferId = connext.xcall{ value: msg.value }(  
89:      _distributorDomain, // destination domain              
90:      address(distributor), // to
91:      address(0), // asset    //@audit - missing delegate
92:      address(0), // delegate, only required for self-execution + slippage
93:      0, // total
94:      0, // slippage
95:      abi.encodePacked(msg.sender, _domain, total, proof) 
96:    );
```

To execute a cross-chain call you need to pay **Relayer Fee**

**Relayer Fee** is a fee charged by relayers on top of normal gas costs in exchange for providing a meta-transaction service. In code snippet on above is paid on line 88.

According to connext [docs](https://docs.connext.network/developers/guides/estimating-fees#bumping-relayer-fees):

> Since gas conditions are impossible to predict, transactions can potentially stay pending on destination if fees aren't high enough. Connext allows the user (or anyone if they are feeling charitable) to increase the original fee until sufficient for relayers.
	Anyone can call the Connext contract function `bumpTransfer` to increase the original relayer fee for an `xcall`.

But such an implementation is missing and therefore it is possible that the transaction remains stuck.

## Impact

The transaction will remain stuck and nobody can react because the protocol is not implemented `bumpTransfer()` function.

## Recommendation

Implemented `bumpTransfer()` function:

```solidity
function bumpTransfer(bytes32 _transferId) external payable;
```
