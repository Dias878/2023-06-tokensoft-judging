# The leaf value should not be exactly 64 bytes long prior to hashing

## Summary
 The leaf value should not be exactly 64 bytes long prior to hashing
## Vulnerability Detail

The size of a leaf is the same size of the parent data that is hashed, both are 64 bytes. As a result it is possible to have a hash collision between a leaf and any node in the tree. This allows for proofs to be repeated multiple times by taking subtrees as leaves.

## Impact
Fraudulent proofs will disrupt the airdrop and transfer funds to invalid addresses.

## Code Snippet

```solidity 

    // Validate the claim
    _verifyMembership(_getLeaf(_beneficiary, _total, _beneficiaryDomain), _proof);
    uint256 claimedAmount = _executeClaim(_beneficiary, _total);

```

```solidity 
  function _getLeaf(
    address _beneficiary, // the address that will receive tokens
    uint256 _total,
    uint32 _domain // the domain of the recipient
  ) internal pure returns (bytes32 _leaf) {
    _leaf = keccak256(abi.encodePacked(_beneficiary, _total, _domain));
  }
```

## Tool used

Manual Review

## Recommendation
Use a combination of variables that doesn't sum to 64 bytes
