# Precision Loss in voteFactor

## Summary
In the AdvancedDistributor.sol, the votefactor is set. However the votefactor can cause precision loss for user IF it is less than the fractionDenominator. 
```solidity

  /**
	* @notice Set the voting power of undistributed tokens
	* @param _voteFactor The voting power multiplier as a fraction of fractionDenominator
	* @dev The vote factor can be any integer. If voteFactor / fractionDenominator == 1,
	* one unclaimed token provides one vote. If voteFactor / fractionDenominator == 2, one
	* unclaimed token counts as two votes.
	*/
```

## Vulnerability Detail
The voting factor is required to be greater than or equal to the, however if the factor is changed to a lesser value than the fractionDenominator, users will get zero votes for no mater the number of unclaimed tokens.
## Impact
Claiming of tokens would give zero votes.
