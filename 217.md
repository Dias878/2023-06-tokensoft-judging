# Unexpected Behavior in `_setTranches` Method

## Summary

The `_setTranches` method in `TrancheVesting.sol` could be manipulated to allow for unexpected behavior if not used properly. Specifically, it does not properly check if `vestedFraction` is less than or equal to the fraction denominator (10000). 

## Vulnerability Detail

The `TrancheVesting.sol` contract uses the `_setTranches` method to set the tranches for a given token. It checks if the `vestedFraction` of a tranche is increasing but does not check if it exceeds the fraction denominator (10000).

This could allow a token to be vested more than expected if `_setTranches` is called with an improper array of `Tranche` structs.

## Impact

The impact of this bug could be very high, as it may result in more tokens being vested than initially planned. If the `vestedFraction` is allowed to be greater than the fraction denominator (10000), the `getVestedFraction` method would return a value greater than 10000, resulting in more tokens being vested than what should be.

## Code Snippet

```solidity
function _setTranches(Tranche[] memory _tranches) private {
 require(_tranches.length != 0, 'tranches required');

 delete tranches;

 uint128 lastTime = 0;
 uint128 lastVestedFraction = 0;

 for (uint256 i = 0; i < _tranches.length; ) {
 require(_tranches[i].vestedFraction != 0, 'tranche vested fraction == 0');
 require(_tranches[i].time > lastTime, 'tranche time must increase');
 require(
 _tranches[i].vestedFraction > lastVestedFraction,
 'tranche vested fraction must increase'
 );
 lastTime = _tranches[i].time;
 lastVestedFraction = _tranches[i].vestedFraction;
 tranches.push(_tranches[i]);

 emit SetTranche(i, _tranches[i]);

 ++i;
 }
}
```

## Tool used

Manual Review

## Recommendation

Ensure that the `vestedFraction` in a `Tranche` struct cannot be more than the fraction denominator (10000). Add a `require` statement to check this condition.

```solidity
require(
 _tranches[i].vestedFraction <= 10000,
 'tranche vested fraction must be less than or equal to 10000'
);
```

## Proof Of Concept

1. Deploy the `TrancheVesting` contract with a token.
2. Call the `_setTranches` function with an array of `Tranche` structs where one of the `Tranche` structs has `vestedFraction` greater than 10000.
3. Observe that the contract does not revert and accepts the `Tranche` structs.
4. Call the `getVestedFraction` function after the tranche's time.
5. Observe that the returned value is greater than 10000, allowing for more tokens to be vested than what should be.
