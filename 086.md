# Lack of Beneficiary Validation in the `initiateClaim` Function

## Summary
The `initiateClaim` function in the `Satellite` contract lacks proper validation of the beneficiary's address and domain when initiating a cross-chain claim. This allows an attacker to provide a valid Merkle proof with arbitrary `msg.sender` and domain values, potentially claiming tokens on behalf of other beneficiaries without their consent.
## Vulnerability Detail
The `initiateClaim` function allows a beneficiary to initiate a cross-chain claim by providing the `total` amount and a Merkle proof. The function first verifies the Merkle proof using the `_verifyMembership` function inherited from the `MerkleSet` contract. However, this verification solely ensures that the provided Merkle proof corresponds to a valid leaf in the Merkle tree rooted at `_merkleRoot`. It does not include validation to check if the claimed amount is allowed for the given `msg.sender` and `domain`.

After the Merkle proof is verified, the function initiates a cross-chain call (xcall) to the `Distributor` contract using Connext. The xcall includes the `total` amount and additional data, including `msg.sender` and the `domain`. The issue arises from the lack of validation on `msg.sender` and `domain`, making it susceptible to abuse.

An attacker can exploit this vulnerability by providing a valid Merkle proof along with their desired `msg.sender` and `domain`. This allows the attacker to claim tokens on behalf of other beneficiaries, potentially leading to unauthorized access to tokens and financial loss.
## Impact
The lack of beneficiary validation in the `initiateClaim` function enables an attacker to claim tokens on behalf of other beneficiaries without proper authorization. This could lead to the unauthorized transfer of funds, compromising the integrity of the distribution system and causing financial harm to legitimate beneficiaries.

## Tool used

Manual Review

## Recommendation
Add validation to ensure that `msg.sender` matches the beneficiary provided as input. This can be done using a simple require statement.
Verify that the `domain` of the `Satellite` contract matches the `domain` stored in the Merkle leaf. This ensures that the claim is initiated from the correct satellite domain.
