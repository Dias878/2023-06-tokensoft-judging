# Because of its deviation threshold the oracle price in `PriceTierVesting` might prevent users from claiming tokens that should actually be claimable

## Summary

Most of the time the Oracle price is not the exact token price but has some deviation from it. This can result in users not being able to claim tokens that should actually be claimable 


## Vulnerability Detail

Chainlink oracles are updated in specific time intervals (heartbeat) or if the current price increases or decreases more than the deviation threshold. Heartbeat can be as long as 24 hours and deviation thresholds can be as high as 2%. This means that if the oracle price is close to a `tierPrice` and the price increases over the `tierPrice` but does not trigger the deviation threshold, tokens that should be claimable will not be claimable until the next scheduled oracle price update (assuming price stays the same). The oracle price update that can take as long as 24 hours. Since tokens can only be claimed while the oracle price is above the `tierPrice`, if the price falls below the tier price again, recipients will not be able to claim the tokens at a later point of time.   

Example:

Oracle:
 	Deviation threshold: 2%
	Heartbeat: 24 hours

Tier Price: 1 USD

The oracle is updated with a price of 0.99 USD. The price of the token increases to 1,000001 USD and the tokens of the tier should be claimable. Since the oracle price is still 0.99 USD recipients still cannot claim their tokens. This can last for up to 24 hours. If the token price goes down to 0.99 USD again before the oracle is updated there was no possibility to claim the tokens even though users expected it to be.

## Impact

Recipients cannot claim tokens that should be claimable and miss out on financial gains they could have had when claiming the tokens and selling them.

## Tool used

Manual Review

## Recommendation

Use a second oracle like a Uniswap Pool as a backup to avoid such a scenario by comparing both prices
