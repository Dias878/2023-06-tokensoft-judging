# Missing price checks for Chainlink oracle

## Summary

When fetching the oracle price there are no checks for the built in circuit breakers from the Chainlink aggregator for the minimum price in `PriceTierVesting._getOraclePrice()` which is used from `PriceTierVestingSale_2_0.getClaimableAmount()`. The circuit breaker should be used to check if the price of an asset goes outside of a predetermined price band.

If an asset suffers a huge drop in value (i.e. LUNA crash), the chainlink oracle will still return the minPrice instead of the actual price of the asset, and the protocol can go into debt or suffer losses, see [Venus on BSC when LUNA imploded](https://rekt.news/venus-blizz-rekt/).

## Vulnerability Detail

`PriceTierVestingSale_2_0.claim()` calls `PriceTierVestingSale_2_0.getClaimableAmount()` which uses `PriceTierVesting.getVestedFraction()` which calls `PriceTierVesting._getOraclePrice()` to determine the price which is used to determine the vested fraction.

`PriceTierVesting._getOraclePrice()` is missing necessary checks via the built in circuit breaks to determine whether the price of an asset went outside of the bounds of min/max prices.

## Impact

The protocol can potentially suffer from a wrong price fetched from the Chainlink oracle, where the fetched price potentially is higher than the actual price of the asset, resulting in calculating claimable amounts higher than they should be, resulting in a loss.

## Tool used

Manual Review

## Recommendation

Consider checking the returned answer from the Chainlink oracle against the min/max price of the built in circuit breakers and revert if the answer is outside of the bounds:

```solidity
// PriceTierVesting.sol
30	function _getOraclePrice() private view returns (uint256) {
31		(
32			uint80 roundID,
33			int256 _price,
34			uint256 startedAt,
35			uint256 timeStamp,
36			uint80 answeredInRound
37		) = oracle.latestRoundData();
38
39 +    if (_price >= maxPrice || _price <= minPrice) { revert(); }
```

See [Chainlink API docs](https://docs.chain.link/data-feeds/api-reference#variables-and-functions-in-accesscontrolledoffchainaggregator) on minAnswer, maxAnswer that provide the prices for minPrice and maxPrice referenced above.
