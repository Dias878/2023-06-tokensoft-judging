# Random Number is always zero in the BasicDistributor

## Summary
In the constructor of the BasicDistributor, a salt value of ``` uint160(uint256(blockhash(block.number - 1)))``` is passed which is used to set the randomValue, in the inheritted contracts. 
However if we check the inheritance, It gives this function
```solidity
  function _setPseudorandomValue(uint160 salt) internal {
    if (distancePerSecond == 0) {
      // there is no delay: random value is not needed
      return;
    }
    require(salt > 0, 'I demand more randomness');
    randomValue = uint160(uint256(blockhash(block.number - 1))) ^ salt;
  }
```
Here the salt is passed in and randomized again
```solidity

  require(salt > 0, 'I demand more randomness');
    randomValue = uint160(uint256(blockhash(block.number - 1))) ^ salt;
  }
```
Calculating this would always give a random num value of zero because
```solidity
uint160(uint256(blockhash(block.number - 1))) ^ uint160(uint256(blockhash(block.number - 1)))  = 0
```
## Vulnerability Detail

## Impact
randomNumber is always zero, which it shouldnt be

## Tool used

Manual Review

## Recommendation
Do not use the same value for salt as is used to get a randomNumber
