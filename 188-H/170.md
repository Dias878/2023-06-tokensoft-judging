# Unsafe casting and a tautological check allow for wrong claims to be accepted

## Summary

The check if the amount of the token claim in `Distributor::_initializeDistributionRecord` is tautological, hence a too-large-to-be-executed claim can be potentially executed without error.

## Vulnerability Detail

The owner is trusted, and it seems that the code considers the case when the owner allocates more than `type(uint120).max` to a single claim, hence it is assumed that the owner may constitute such a leaf in the merkle tree whose root is committed.

For example, the specification allows the owner to commit a record that is equal to `uint(-1)` for any accounting reason. The contract should revert upon such a claim, so such a leaf would essentially be useless. It could be used, for example, to separate some groups of claim beneficiaries.

Such a leaf is expected to be ignored, as the initialization of such a large claim is to be reverted. But, due to [the implementation of the `_initializeDistributionRecord` function](https://github.com/sherlock-audit/2023-06-tokensoft/blob/main/contracts/contracts/claim/abstract/Distributor.sol#L40-L59), the distribution record would successfully initialized with the amount skimmed to 120 bits. Hence, if the value was `uint(-1)`, the value totalAmount would be parsed as `uint120(-1)`. This is because in the [token amount check](https://github.com/sherlock-audit/2023-06-tokensoft/blob/main/contracts/contracts/claim/abstract/Distributor.sol#L53-L54), the already skimmed `totalAmount` is considered instead of the value of `_totalAmount`, which is an `uint256`. Hence, the check validates that a variable of type `uint120` is not greated than the maximum value of `uint120`, which is always true.

In this case, the `beneficiary` incorrectly receives `uint120(-1)` (read: a lot!) tokens.

## Impact

A claim can be initialized for overflowing (incorrect) variables, causing a possibility of a loss of funds.

Because some assumptions were made concerning the state of the merkle tree (or any other initialization method), the severity is medium.

## Code Snippet

```js
  /**
   * @dev Set up the distribution record for a user. Permissions are not checked in this function.
   * Amount is limited to type(uint120).max to allow each DistributionRecord to be packed into a single storage slot.
   * 
   * @param beneficiary The address of the beneficiary
   * @param _totalAmount The total amount of tokens to be distributed to the beneficiary
   */
  function _initializeDistributionRecord(
    address beneficiary,
    uint256 _totalAmount
  ) internal virtual {
    uint120 totalAmount = uint120(_totalAmount);

    // Checks
    require(totalAmount <= type(uint120).max, 'Distributor: totalAmount > type(uint120).max');

    // Effects - note that the existing claimed quantity is re-used during re-initialization
    records[beneficiary] = DistributionRecord(true, totalAmount, records[beneficiary].claimed);
    emit InitializeDistributionRecord(beneficiary, totalAmount);
  }
```

## Tool used

Manual Review

## Recommendation

Use `_totalAmount` instead of `totalAmount` in the `require` statement.
