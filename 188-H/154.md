# Unsafe casting causes possible overflow

## Summary

Unsafe castint can cause silent overflow and store wrong amounts.

## Vulnerability Detail

In Distributor.sol:_initializeDistributionRecord the parameter `_totalAmount` of type `uint256` is casted to an `uint120` and stored in the local variable `totalAmount`.
THere is a check in the next  line for `totalAmount to be less or equal to the uint120 max amount.
However, this check is useless as it will always retur true. This is because the casting in the previous line will silently overflow in case the amount is higher than the maximum  for uint120. This will result in the wrong amount to be stored in the DistributionRecord.

## Impact

Wrong amount is stored in DistributionRecord

## Tool used

Manual Review

## Recommendation

- Maybe thinking about using uin120 parameters instead of uint256 and directly casting them down.
- Check if it is safe to cast the value before actually casting it.
- Also the safeCast Library can be used to ensure the function reverts instead of silently overflowing.
