# Unsafe uint120 casting may overflow

## Summary

Unsafe `uint120` casting is used in `Distributor._initializeDistributionRecord()` function, which may lead to an overflow and mint an excessive amount of vote tokens that cannot be burned completely.

## Vulnerability Detail

In the `Distributor.sol` contract, the function `_initializeDistributionRecord` internally casts the `_totalAmount` parameter to a `uint120` value. While Solidity 0.8.x checks for overflows on arithmetic operations, it does not do so for casting. If the `_totalAmount` provided during initialization is larger than `type(uint120).max`, the casting to `uint120` will overflow, and `totalAmount` will hold an unintended, potentially smaller value. This overflown `totalAmount` is already within 
 the range of type(uint120).max, which ALWAYS pass the require() check in the line after.
```solidity
function _initializeDistributionRecord(
    address beneficiary,
    uint256 _totalAmount
  ) internal virtual {
    uint120 totalAmount = uint120(_totalAmount);

    // Checks
    require(totalAmount <= type(uint120).max, 'Distributor: totalAmount > type(uint120).max');
	...
  }
```

However, in the overridden `AdvancedDistributor._initializeDistributionRecord()` function, the large `totalAmount` is not properly caught and is then used to mint the vote tokens for the beneficiary. As a result, an unintended large amount of vote tokens will be minted for the beneficiary. Additionally, the excess vote tokens cannot be fully burned by the `adjust()` function, causing the system's invariant to be compromised.
```solidity
function _initializeDistributionRecord(
  address beneficiary,
  uint256 totalAmount
) internal virtual override {
  super._initializeDistributionRecord(beneficiary, totalAmount);

  // add voting power through ERC20Votes extension
  _mint(beneficiary, tokensToVotes(totalAmount));
}

function adjust(address beneficiary, int256 amount) external onlyOwner {
  ...
  if (amount < 0) {
    // decreasing claimable tokens
    require(total >= diff, 'decrease greater than distributor total');
    require(distributionRecord.total >= diff, 'decrease greater than distributionRecord total');
    total -= diff;
    records[beneficiary].total -= uint120(diff);
    token.safeTransfer(owner(), diff);
    // reduce voting power

    // @audit
    // since diff never exceeds distributionRecord.total which is smaller than the incorrectly minted votes,
    // _burn() cannot clear all votes from beneficiary. 
    _burn(beneficiary, tokensToVotes(diff));
  }
  ...
}
```

## Impact
Invalidly minted vote tokens could not be cleared/retrieved completely, rendering the governance system un-useable due to compromised integrity.

## Tool used

Manual Review

## Recommendation

To avoid potential overflow during casting, it is recommended to put the `require` statement to check `_totalAmount` before performing the casting.

In the `Distributor.sol`:
```solidity
function _initializeDistributionRecord(
    address beneficiary,
    uint256 _totalAmount
  ) internal virtual {
    // Checks
    require(_totalAmount <= type(uint120).max, 'Distributor: _totalAmount > type(uint120).max');
    uint120 totalAmount = uint120(_totalAmount);
    ...
  }
```
