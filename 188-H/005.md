# The totalAmount check is problematic and can be greater than uint120

## Summary

`_initializeDistributionRecord`  will check in `totalAmount` less than uint120, but is after uint120 conversion, so check is always true.
The contract creator can input more than uint120 and cast more votes to the beneficiary than uint120.

## Vulnerability Detail

```solidity
  function _initializeDistributionRecord(
    address beneficiary,
    uint256 _totalAmount
  ) internal virtual {
    uint120 totalAmount = uint120(_totalAmount);

    // Checks
    require(totalAmount <= type(uint120).max, 'Distributor: totalAmount > type(uint120).max');

    // Effects - note that the existing claimed quantity is re-used during re-initialization
    records[beneficiary] = DistributionRecord(true, totalAmount, records[beneficiary].claimed);
    emit InitializeDistributionRecord(beneficiary, totalAmount);
  }
```

It is not the input parameter `_totalAmount` that is checked, but the converted `totalAmount`, so check will always pass regardless of `_totalAmount`.

```solidity
  function tokensToVotes(uint256 tokenAmount) private view returns (uint256) {
    return (tokenAmount * voteFactor) / fractionDenominator;
  }

  function _initializeDistributionRecord(
    address beneficiary,
    uint256 totalAmount
  ) internal virtual override {
    super._initializeDistributionRecord(beneficiary, totalAmount);

    // add voting power through ERC20Votes extension
    _mint(beneficiary, tokensToVotes(totalAmount));
  }
```

When the `totalAmount` of uint120 is exceeded, the corresponding number of votes is given to the beneficiary mint, resulting in internal accounting system confusion and inconsistency.

## Impact

`records[beneficiary]` uses the converted value of uint120, but mint to beneficiary a value greater than uint120, causing confusion and inconsistency in the internal accounting system.

## Recommendation

Check `_totalAmount` instead of `totalAmount`
