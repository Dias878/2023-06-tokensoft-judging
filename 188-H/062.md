# wrong check when casting of user amount from uint256 to uint120

## Summary
wrong validation when casting from uint256 to uint120 which lead to user  funds lose
## Vulnerability Detail
The Function **Distributor._initializeDistributionRecord** takes two arguments an **address** and  a **uint256** variables  and  on line 54 it will check if the **uint256** variable is greater than uint120.max if it is it will ,throw an error **_'Distributor: totalAmount > type(uint120).max'_** 
`    require(totalAmount <= type(uint120).max, 'Distributor: totalAmount > type(uint120).max');
` but  before that on line 51 it will unsafely cast the variable to uint120 
`    uint120 totalAmount = uint120(_totalAmount);
` so even if the variable is greater than uint120 it will not revert because it is already  casted unsafely to uint120 on line 51
## Impact
Loss of funds.

## Recommendation
first check if the variable is less than the max value of uin120 before firstly changing it to
