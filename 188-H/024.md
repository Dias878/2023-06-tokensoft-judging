# Unsafe downcast of _totalAmount

## Summary

`_totalAmount` is down casted from uint256 to uint120 in an unsafe manner.

## Vulnerability Detail

The require check `require(totalAmount <= type(uint120).max)` will always pass because `totalAmount` will always be a value that is smaller than or equal to `type(uint120).max` after being downcasted from `_totalAmount`. 

## Impact

The most significant bits are truncated which will result in users having a different amount initialized in their record than compared to the argument that was passed into the function.

Having said that said, the `totalAmount` should not be greater than type(uint120).max regardless so the owner will most likely still have to make a manual adjustment to fix this mistake.

## Tool used

Manual Review

## Recommendation
```solidity
function _initializeDistributionRecord(
    address beneficiary,
    uint256 _totalAmount
) internal virtual {
    // Checks
    require(_totalAmount<= type(uint120).max, 'Distributor: totalAmount > type(uint120).max');
    uint120 totalAmount = uint120(_totalAmount);

    // Effects - note that the existing claimed quantity is re-used during re-initialization
    records[beneficiary] = DistributionRecord(true, totalAmount, records[beneficiary].claimed);
    emit InitializeDistributionRecord(beneficiary, totalAmount);
}
```
