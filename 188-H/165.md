# Unsafe conversion from uint256 to uint120, and incorrect check.

## Summary
Unsafe conversion from uint256 to uint120, and incorrect check.
## Vulnerability Detail
Let's take a look at the following code. The `_totalAmount parameter` is first converted to `uint120`, and then the condition `totalAmount <= type(uint120).max` is checked. This will result in an invalid check. This is clearly unreasonable. The correct approach should be to compare `_totalAmount` with `type(uint120).max` first, and then perform the conversion to `uint120` if the condition is met.

  function _initializeDistributionRecord(
    address beneficiary,
    uint256 _totalAmount
  ) internal virtual {
    uint120 totalAmount = uint120(_totalAmount);

    // Checks
    require(totalAmount <= type(uint120).max, 'Distributor: totalAmount > type(uint120).max');

    // Effects - note that the existing claimed quantity is re-used during re-initialization
    records[beneficiary] = DistributionRecord(true, totalAmount, records[beneficiary].claimed);
    emit InitializeDistributionRecord(beneficiary, totalAmount);
  }

Moreover, many other parts of the code do not consider overflow situations when converting uint256 to uint120. This could lead to serious protocol errors and potential loss of funds.

  function _executeClaim(
    address beneficiary,
    uint256 _totalAmount
  ) internal virtual returns (uint256) {
    uint120 totalAmount = uint120(_totalAmount);

    // effects
    if (records[beneficiary].total != totalAmount) {
      // re-initialize if the total has been updated
      _initializeDistributionRecord(beneficiary, totalAmount);
    }
    
    uint120 claimableAmount = uint120(getClaimableAmount(beneficiary));
    require(claimableAmount > 0, 'Distributor: no more tokens claimable right now');

    records[beneficiary].claimed += claimableAmount;
    claimed += claimableAmount;

    return claimableAmount;
  }


## Impact
This could lead to serious protocol errors and potential loss of funds.

## Tool used
vscode、Manual Review

## Recommendation
 Use the correct check sequence.
 use OpenZeppelin’s SafeCast library when casting from uint256 to uint128.
