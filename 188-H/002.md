# `Distributor` - Incorrect type checking in `_initializeDistributionRecord`

## Summary
Amount checking is done after typecast, which will always be true.

## Vulnerability Detail
https://github.com/sherlock-audit/2023-06-tokensoft/blob/main/contracts/contracts/claim/abstract/Distributor.sol#L51-L54

`totalAmount` already has `uint120` type through type-cast, so the require statement will always pass even if the input parameter `_totalAmount` is greater than `uint120.max`

## Impact
When the amount is bigger than `uint120.max`, it should revert, but the contract assigns claimable amount to the beneficiary with `uint120` type-casted amount.

## Code Snippet

## Tool used

Manual Review

## Recommendation
Use `_totalAmount` in require statement, rather than `totalAmount`.
