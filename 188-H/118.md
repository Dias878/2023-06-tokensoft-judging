# Beneficiary may be initialised with the incorrect tokenAmount due to require check on wrong variable.

## Summary

A beneficiary may be initialised with a smaller tokenAmount than expected due to a require check occurring after an unsafe cast.

## Vulnerability Detail

If a token with high decimals, low value and a long vesting period is used it's possible the token amount could be higher than the max uint120 value. There is a require check to catch when this happens however due to the order of operations the cast will happen before the check. Instead of reverting the cast of _totalAmount will overflow and become a much smaller number which will pass the check and initialise the beneficiary with a much smaller amount of claimable tokens then they are expecting.

## Impact

A beneficiary may be initialised with a much smaller claimable token amount then they are expecting.

## Tool used

Manual Review

## Recommendation

Move the require check on [line 54]() to before the assignment of totalAmount and change the check from totalAmount to _totalAmount. alternatively safeCast can be used preventing the cast from overflowing silently.

```Solidity
require(_totalAmount <= type(uint120).max, 'Distributor: totalAmount > type(uint120).max');
uint120 totalAmount = uint120(_totalAmount);
```
