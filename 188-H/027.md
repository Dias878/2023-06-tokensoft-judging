# Unsafe down casting in `distributor. _initializeDistributionRecord`

## Summary

Unsafe downcast in `distributor. _initializeDistributionRecord` can lead to wrong claimable amount for recipients when using the `BasicDistributor.sol`

## Vulnerability Detail

Even though there is a check that is supposed to protect the function `distributor. _initializeDistributionRecord` from unsafe down casting, it does not work because it checks if the already down casted variable is smaller or equal to `type(uint120).max`. 

In the constructor of `BasicDistributor.sol` the function `_initializeDistributionRecord` is used to initialize all records for the recipients qualified for the distribution. Because the check for the safe downcast does not work, an amount bigger than `type(uint120).max` will be store with the wrongly in the recipientâ€™s `distributionRecord` 

## Impact

The distirbutionRecord of some recipients are wrong and they can only claim less tokens than they are owed.

## Tool used

Manual Review

## Recommendation

Check `_totalAmount` instead of `totalAmount`

Change this:
require(`totalAmount` <= type(uint120).max, 'Distributor: totalAmount > type(uint120).max');

to this:
require(`_totalAmount` <= type(uint120).max, 'Distributor: totalAmount > type(uint120).max');
